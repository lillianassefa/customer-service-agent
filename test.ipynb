It provides the necessary instructions for how the device com municates with the other \\ncomputer hardware. Firmware is typically stored in the flash ROM of a hardware device.', 'While ROM is \"read-only memory,\" flash ROM can be erased and rewritten because it is \\nactually a type of flash memory. \\nExample: \\nEmbedded Systems, computers, computer peripherals, mobile ph ones, and digital cameras. \\n \\n Motherboard \\nA motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a c omputer system. It is also \\ncalled as printed circuit board , system board , baseboard , planar board or logic board. \\nThe large PCB of a motherboard may include 6 -14 layers of fiberglass, copper connecting', 'traces and copper planes for power and signal isolation. Additional components can be added \\nto a motherboard through its expansion slots. \\nHere are some of the typical parts: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 A CPU socket - the actual CPU is directly soldered onto the  socket.

Unlike main memory (RAM), ROM retains its contents  even when the computer is', 'turned off. ROM is referred to as being nonvolatile, whereas  RAM is volatile. Data stored in \\nROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or n ot at all, so it is mainly used to \\nstore firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need \\nfrequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges. \\n \\n RAM  – Random Access memory \\nHigh Speed memory and it can save the program and data te mporarily.

It is used to improve parallelization of computations performed on PC', \"microprocessor. This technique is enables single CPU to act li ke multiple CPU’s. it also  \\nenables different parts of the CPU to work on different tasks concurrently. \\n \\nb) TURBO BOOST TECHNOLOGY \\nIntel Turbo Boost is a technology implemented by Intel in certain versions of its \\nprocessors that enables the processor to run above its bas e operating frequency via dynamic \\ncontrol of the processor's clock rate. The increased clock rate is limited by the\", 'processor\\'s power, current and thermal limits, as well as the number of cores currently in use \\nand the maximum frequency of the active cores. Processo r generations supporting this feature \\nare based on the Nehalem (Turbo Boost 1.0), Sandy Bridge (Tur bo Boost 2.0) \\n \\nC) MULTICORE TECHNOLOGY \\nA multi-core processor is a single computing component wit h two or more \\nindependent actual processing units (called \"cores\"), which ar e units that read and', 'execute program instructions. The instructions are ordinar y CPU instructions such as add, \\nmove data, and branch, but the multiple cores can run mu ltiple instructions at the same time, \\nincreasing overall speed for programs amenable to parallel  computing. \\n11  \\n  CHIPSET \\nChipset is a group of Integrated Circuits that are desig ned to work together to serve a \\nsingle function and are usually marketed as a single product.  It refers to a set of specialized', 'chips on the motherboard or an expansion card. It refers to a pair of chips on the motherboard \\n– Northbridge and Southbridge. A chipset controls communica tion between processor and \\nexternal devices, thus plays an important role in determining system performance. \\n \\n BUS STANDARDS \\nA collection   of   wires   through   which data is   tra nsmitted   from   one   part   of \\na computer to another. All buses consist of two parts : an addr ess bus and a data bus. The data', 'bus transfers actual data whereas the address bus transfer s information about where the data \\nshould go. The fastest bus is within CPU chip. This connects  the processor and its primary \\ncache. The next level is system bus or local bus. Thi s connects processor with main memory \\nand Level 2 cache. The system bus is 64 bits wide and its s peed is 100MHz. The next level is \\nI/O bus.

The featur es are, \\n\\uf0b7 AGP introduces a dedicated point- to-point channel so that the graphics controller can', 'directly access main memory. \\n\\uf0b7 The AGP channel is 32 bits wide and runs at 66 MHz. This translates into a \\ntotal bandwidth of 266 MBps, as opposed to the PCI bandwidth of 133 MBps. \\n\\uf0b7 Sideband Addressing: Speeds up data transfers by sending command instr uctions in a \\nseparate, parallel channel. \\n13  \\n \\uf0b7 AGP supports two optional faster modes, with throughputs of 533 MBps  and 1.07 \\nGBps. In addition, AGP allows 3-D textures to be stored in mai n memory rather than \\nvideo memory.', 'video memory. \\n\\uf0b7 Throughput: Various levels of throughput are offered: 1X is 266 MBps,  2X is 533 \\nMBps and 4X provides 1.07 GBps. \\n\\uf0b7 Pipelining: Enables the graphics card to send several instruction s together instead of \\nsending one at a time. \\nDifference between AGP and PCI \\n \\n \\n \\n Overview and features of PCMCIA bus \\nThe PCMCIA refers Personal Computer Memory Card Intern ational Association. It is', 'an   industry   group   organized   in   1989   to   promote   sta ndards   for   a   credit   card- \\nsize memory or I/O device that would fit into a personal co mputer, usually a notebook or \\nlaptop computer. There are three types of PC cards, \\n\\uf0b7 Type I PC Cards are typically used for memory devices such  as RAM, Flash, \\nOTP, and SRAM cards \\n\\uf0b7 Type II PC Cards are typically used for I/O devices such as da ta/fax modems, \\nLANs, and mass storage devices.', 'LANs, and mass storage devices. \\n\\uf0b7 Type III PC Cards are used for devices whose components are  thicker, such as \\nrotating mass storage devices. These Extended cards allow th e addition of \\ncomponents that must remain outside the system for proper operation, such as \\nantennas for wireless applications. \\n14  \\n Block diagram of PCMICA \\n \\n \\n \\nThe features are, \\nCard Information Structure: \\nThe CIS describes the characteristics and capabilities o f the card so the host system', 'can automatically configure it. CIS is defined in the Metaforma t Specification. \\nCard Bus: \\nCard Bus allows PC Cards and hosts to use 32-bit bus mastering and to operate at \\nspeeds up to 33MHz. \\n \\nDMA: \\nThe Standard allows cards to utilize Direct Memory Access technology directly in the \\nhardware when matched with a corresponding host syste m. \\neXecute In Place (XIP): \\nAllows operating system and application software to run directl y from the PC Card,', 'eliminating the need for large amounts of system RAM. \\nLow Voltage Operation: \\nThe Standard enables 3.3 and 5-volt operation. A physical keyi ng mechanism for 3.3- \\nvolt cards protects them from being damaged in a 5-volt sl ot. \\nMultiple Function PC Cards: \\nThe Standard enables truly standardized multiple function PC-Cards. \\nPlug and Play: \\nPC Cards can be inserted or removed while the system is o n because power and', 'ground contact pins are the longest contacts, ensuring that  disconnect signals disengage first, \\npreserving data integrity. \\nPower Management: \\nThe Standard provides a means to interface to APM (Advanced Power Management) \\nthrough the Card Services Specification. \\nZoomed Video (ZV): \\nZoomed Video is a connection between a PC Card and host s ystem that allows the \\ncard to write video data directly to the VGA controller. The  data is transferred with no', 'buffering requirements because it is transferred over the ZV bus and not the system bus . \\n15  \\n  Primary Memory \\n Introduction \\nPrimary memory is also known as primary storage or main memory. It is \\ncomputer memory that is accessed directly by the CPU. This is used to store currently \\nrunning programs and data temporarily. These are stored as blocks. The two important \\noperations in a memory are storing and retrieving. Retrievi ng data from a large block takes', 'long time than from a small block. So time of execution will increase. \\nTo avoid this problem cache memory is used to speed up the memory retrieval \\nprocess. The CPU comes with relatively small amount cache compared with main memory. It \\nis also called as Static RAM(SRAM). \\n \\n Cache Memory \\ncache memory or memory cache is a fast and relatively small memory, not visible \\nto the software, that is completely handled by the hardware , that stores the most recently used', '(MRU ) main memory (MM) (or working memory) data. The function  of the cache memory is \\nto speed up the MM data access (performance increasing) and most important, in \\nmultiprocessor systems with shared memory, to reduce the  system bus and MM traffic that is \\none of the major bottleneck of these systems. \\nCache memory makes   use   of   the   fast   technology  SRAM (static   random- \\naccess memory cells ), against a slower MM DRAM (dynamic random-access memory),', 'connected directly to the processor(s ). \\n \\n \\n \\nCache memory is fast and expensive. Traditionally, it is categorized as \"levels\" that \\ndescribe its closeness and accessibility to the microproce ssor: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Level 1 ( L1) cache is extremely fast but relatively small, and is usually embedded in the \\nprocessor chip (CPU). \\n16  \\n \\uf0b7 Level 2 (L2) cache is often more capacious than L1; it may be located on t he CPU or on a', 'separate chip or coprocessor with a high-speed alternative  system bus interconnecting the \\ncache to the CPU, so as not to be slowed by traffic on the ma in system bus. \\n\\uf0b7 Level 3 (L3) cache is typically specialized memory that works to improve the \\nperformance of L1 and L2. It can be significantly slower than L1 or L2, but is usually \\ndouble the speed of RAM. In the case of multicore process ors, each core may have its own', 'dedicated L1 and L2 cache, but share a common L3 cache. When an instruction is \\nreferenced in the L3 cache, it is typically elevated to a higher tier cache. \\n Main memory \\n \\nThe main memory of the computer is also known as RAM , standing for Random \\nAccess Memory. It is constructed from integrated circui ts and needs to have electrical power \\nin order to maintain its information. When power is lost,  the information is lost too. It can be \\ndirectly accessed by the CPU.', 'directly accessed by the CPU. \\nThe access time to read or write any particular byte are independent of whereabouts in \\nthe memory that byte is, and currently is approximately 50 nanoseconds (a thousand \\nmillionth of a second). This is broadly comparable with th e speed at which the CPU will need \\nto access data. Main memory is expensive compared to extern al memory so it has limited \\ncapacity. Data transfer between CPU and memory takes place in a clock cycle called bus', 'cycle.

The hard disk drive \\nwas invented by an IBM in 1954 with 5MB capacity. Nowadays, HDD wi th 3.5inch or 5.25 \\ninch platters in different capacities such as 10GB, 20GB, 40GB,  80GB etc. \\n Construction: \\nHard disks are rigid platters, composed of a substrate and a magnetic medium. The', 'substrate platter’s base material must be non -magnetic and capable of being machined to a \\nsmooth finish. It is made either of aluminum alloy or a mixture of glass and ceramic. It \\nallows data storage, both sides of each platter are coate d with a magnetic medium – formerly \\nmagnetic oxide, but now, almost exclusively, a layer of met al called a thin-film medium. This \\nstores data in magnetic patterns, with each platter capabl e of storing a billion or so bits per', 'square inch (bpsi) of platter surface. \\n \\n \\n19  \\n Head Actuator: \\nThe actuator is the device used to position the head arms t o different tracks on the \\nsurface of the platter (actually, to different cylinders, s ince all head arms are moved as a \\nsynchronous unit, so each arm moves to the same track number of its respective surface). \\nThe actuator is a very important part of the hard disk, beca use changing from track to', 'track is the only operation on the hard disk that require s active movement: changing heads is \\nan electronic function, and changing sectors involves wait ing for the right sector number to \\nspin around and come under the head (passive movement). Ch anging tracks means the heads \\nmust be shifted so making sure this movement can be done quic kly and accurately is of \\nparamount importance. \\n \\nSpindle motor \\nThe spindle motor is used to rotate the shaft or spindle w here the platters or discs are', 'placed. This motor rotates at a speed of 3600 rpm. All the platter s move in the same direction. \\nThe speed of the motor is controlled by an electronics m onitor. \\n \\nLogic Boards \\nThese are electronic boards which are used to control the drives spindle and head \\nactuator systems. \\n \\nOrganization of hard disk \\n \\nEach disk has two recording surface. The top portion of th e disk and bottom portion \\ndisk are not used. It acts as a protection plate. Each recording surface is divided into tracks. A', 'set of corresponding tracks in all sides of disks is ca lled a cylinder. A given file or record is \\nstored on one cylinder. Each track is further divided into s ectors. A sector is the smallest \\naddressable part of the disk and each sector class has 512 byt e of data. The presence of \\nmagnetized spot represents 1 bit and its absence represe nt 0 bit. The storage capacity of a \\ndisk is calculated by the formula of', 'disk is calculated by the formula of \\nStorage capacity = Number of cylinders X Tracks per cylinders X Sectors per track X Byes \\nper Sector. \\n \\n Working principle \\nThe working of hard disk depends on the file allocation table entry (FTA) \\nis a table present in the beginning of the partition containing details about the data stored an d \\nfree area location in hard disk.

CD-R Stands for \"Compact Disc \\nRecordable.\" CD-R discs are blank CDs that can record data  written by a CD burner. The \\ndata burned onto a CD-R disc is permanent, meaning it cannot be altered or erased like the \\ndata on a hard drive. \\nTypically, once a CD has been burned, it will not be able to record any more data. Some CD \\nburning programs can record data as \"sessions,\" allowing a di sc to be written to multiple', 'times until it is full. Each session creates a new part ition on the disc, meaning a computer will \\nread a disc with multiple sessions as multiple discs. CD-RWs, on the other hand, can be \\nerased and completely re-recorded. Like CDs, the data on CD-RWs cannot be altered, \\nmeaning the disc has to be completely erased each time you want to add new data.

Unlike a CD-R (CD-Recordable), a CD-RW can be written to \\nmultiple times. The data burned on a CD-RW cannot be cha nged, but it can be erased. \\nTherefore, you have to completely erase a CD-RW every time you want to change the files or \\nadd new data. While it may be somewhat inconvenient, this capability makes CD-RWs a', \"good choice for making frequent backups. However, because CD-R Ws can be erased, they \\ndon't store data reliably for as long as CD-Rs do. Therefor e, you should use regular CD- Rs \\nfor long-term backups. \\n \\nThe technology behind CD-RW is optical phase-change, whic h in its own right is \\nnothing radical. However, the technology used in CD-Rewrit able does not incorporate any \\nmagnetic field like the phase-change technology.

The \\n25  \\n recording layer is sandwiched between dielectric layers t hat draw excess heat from the phase- \\nchange layer during the writing process. In place of the C D-R disc’s dye -based recording \\nlayer, CD-RW commonly uses a crystalline compound made up of a mix of silver, indium, \\nantimony and tellurium. This rather exotic mix has a very special property: when it’s heated', 'to one temperature and cooled it becomes crystalline, but if it’s heated to a higher \\ntemperature, when it cools down again it becomes amorphous. The crystalline areas allow the \\nmetalised layer to reflect the laser better while the n on-crystalline portion absorbs the laser \\nbeam, so it is not reflected. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe different layers are, \\n \\nProtective layer - This is a lacquer coating layer.

In this display \\nis made up of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals are transpare nt substances having a property of \\nboth solid and liquid. \\n \\nLCD principles \\nMost liquid crystals contain long rod-like molecules. In their natural state the', 'molecules are arranged (aligned) almost parallel to their long axis. By placing the liquid \\ncrystal in a finely grooved surface, the molecules arrange ment can be controlled that is, if the \\ngrooves are parallel, the alignment of molecules also be comes exactly parallel. \\n49  \\n  \\n \\nPolarizing filter-light is made to fall on the polarizing filter.The polarizing filter \\nchanges the direction of the light parallel to the axi s of the filter.Thatis, it allows only the', 'light rays parallel to its axis. Refer Grooved plate1 and pla te2-liquid crystals are placed in the \\nfinely grooved plates are kept perpendicular. So the plate 2 molecules are arranged in north to \\nsouth direction and the plate 1 molecules are arranged in  east west direction. Because of this, \\nmolecules are forced to a twisted state of 900. Therefore, the light passing through this is \\ntwisted to 900 Polarizing filter on the bottom-this polarizer is kept perpen dicular to the top', 'filter. Since the light rays from the polarizer is t wisted to 900 \\n \\nElectric voltage is given across the liquid crystal, t he molecules between the grooved \\nplates realign vertically. Because of this, the polari zed light is passed through without any \\ntwist. So the bottom polarizer does not allow the light to pa ss producing a dark pixel. \\nColour LCD displays use additional red, green, blue coloured fi lters over three separate LCD \\nelements to create a single multicolour pixel.', 'elements to create a single multicolour pixel. \\nBy changing the across the voltage across the liquid crys tal, we can make the images to \\nappear on the screen. \\n \\n TFT displays \\n \\nThe full form of TFT is thin film transistor. This tran sistor is a special kind of field \\neffect transistor. This is made by depositing a thin film of  a semiconductor layer over a \\ndielectric such as glass. This technology is used to impro ve the image quality of LCD’s by', 'eliminating ghosting and slow response speed of image s. \\n \\nConstruction \\n50  \\n TFT LCD displays are made by placing liquid crystals in-betwe en two glass plates namely \\ncolor filter and FTF glass. \\nTFT glass has number of thin transistor (TFT)to match th e number of pixels to be \\ndisplayed. Color filter glass has color filter to genera te color. Voltage is given between the \\ncolour filter glass and TFT glass. \\n \\nWorking', 'colour filter glass and TFT glass. \\n \\nWorking \\nWhen an electric voltage is applied, liquid crystals mov e according to the difference \\nin voltage between the color filter glass and the TFT glass. The direction of polarization \\nchanges depending upon the amount of voltage. As the polariz ation direction changes, more \\nor less light passes through the polarization layer on the  face of the display. \\nThe image in TFT panel is formed by a method called active  matrix driving. The figure given', 'below shows the structure of the active matrix LCD. \\nTFT are formed by means of a thin film of silicon deposit ed on a glass plate. The \\ntransistor acts as a pixel and the remaining area are et ched away to allow light to pass. \\nDepending on the amount of light passed, the transistors act like a storage capacitor and \\nrefresh to display the image. \\n \\n LED  displays \\nThe full form of LED is light emitting diode. This is a  special kind of diode. When', 'electric current is applied it emits light. In LED TV, an array of LED bules are used to \\nprovide the back light to illuminate the display. The figure gi ven below shows the structure of \\nLED displays. \\nThe working principle of LED TV is same as LCD, but instead o f fluorescent back \\nlight LED light is used. LED array consumes less space a nd weight than fluorescent one. \\nTherefore, the thickness and weight of the LED T via les s than the LCD TV. LED TV gives', 'much more color quality than the LCD. There are two type s of LED more color quality than \\nthe LCD. There are two types of LED TV. \\n \\n(i) Edge LED lighting \\n(ii) Full LED lighting \\nEdge LED  TV consists of light emitting diodes around the edge of the back light panel. The \\nlight enters from the outer edge to the middle of the scr een. \\nFull LED  TV consists of LED’s  across the entre back. \\n \\n Graphics cards \\n \\nVideo Graphics Card \\n(VGA) Introduction', 'Video Graphics Card \\n(VGA) Introduction \\nA video card is used to process images so they can be di splayed on your monitor.

The figure given below shows the structures of a se rvo stabilizer. \\n \\nConstruction \\nServo stabilizer is made up of an auto transformer. This h as two windings wound in \\ndifferent direction as shown in the above figure. Ther e is a moving contact which moves over', 'the windings. The moving contact is rotated by a servo motor.  The error amplifier is used to \\ngive an error voltage to the driver which the servo motor.  \\n \\nWorking \\nIn ordinary stabilizer, the transformer ha s number of tappings or windings. With the help of \\nrelays, the appropriate tapping can be switched to give output v oltage that is nearly equal to \\nthe line voltage required. \\n \\nBut in servo stabilizer there is an error amplifier to give an error there is an error amplifier to', 'give an error voltage. This voltage is got by subtracting the dc reference voltage Vref and dc \\n54  \\n voltage rectified from the output line. This voltage driv es the servo motor in a direction to \\nboost or buck the output voltage from the secondary of the  transformer. \\nSince the error amplifier continuously monitors the output voltage, we get constant voltage \\noutput. By adjusting the value of Vref, we can set the desired output  voltage. \\n \\n \\n Uninterrupted power supply(UPS)', 'Uninterrupted power supply(UPS) \\n \\nUninterrupted power supplies are used to provide continuous power to the computer \\nsystem during availability of a/c and during power cut.

The SPS changes the load to the inverter and it draws from the attached \\nbatteries and supplies continuous power. \\n \\nDisadvantages \\n(i) Electronic sensor takes a finite to sense power failure. So  system will shut down. \\n(ii) Switching time is high, so system will shut down. \\n(iii) Power regulation is poor \\n(iv) No protection against surges or spikes. \\n55  \\n (ii) ON- line ups \\n \\n \\nAs Shown in the above figure, batteries are always connected to the output through', 'inverter. So always it is supplying power from the battery to the  computer. Therefore on – \\nline ups’s  get never interrupted because it does not need to switch its output from main \\npower to batteries. \\n \\nWhen AC power is available, the batteries are charged thro ugh the rectifier circuit.

Surge suppressor is a device inserted in', 'the AC line to prevent damage to electronic equipment from over voltage. \\n \\nSpike is defined as a over voltage that lasts for shorter durat ion say one or two nano \\nseconds. This damages the electronic equipments. Spike isolator is a device inserted in the \\nAC line to prevent damage to electronic equipment from over voltage. \\n \\nOperation \\n56  \\n Normally the standard voltages in India is 240v. If the vo ltage rises above 240volts', 'there is a problem in the input voltage. Surge or spike suppr essor helps to prevent the over \\nvoltage from damaging the equipments. The figure given belo w shows the structure of a \\nsurge or spike suppressor. \\n \\nThe main part of the surge suppressor is metal oxide varist or called MOV. This \\ncontains a piece of metal oxide material in the middle joined to the power and grounding line \\nby two semi conductors. The varistor is a variable resis tance and this depends on voltage.', 'Let the threshold voltage be ± 230. When the input voltage is below this, the electrons \\nin the semi conductor flow in such a way to create a very high resistance. Therefore no \\ncurrent flows to ground. But if the input voltage exceeds the t hreshold, the electrons in the \\nsemiconductor flow in such a way to create a low resistance and allow the extra current to \\nflow to ground. When the input voltage is correct MOV does not hing. By increasing the', 'resistance, the input current is controlled. \\n \\n SMPS \\nSMPS stands for switch mode power supply.

This \\nunregulated Dc voltage is fed to a high frequency DC- to – DC converter to produce \\nregulated Dc voltage levels. \\n \\nOperation', 'regulated Dc voltage levels. \\n \\nOperation \\n \\nThe power supplies used in computers are switched mode power supplie s. The primary \\npower received from a.c mains is rectified and filtered as  high – voltage Dc. Then it is \\nswitched on to a high frequency approximately 10 to 100 KHz by a  bipolar transistor and fed \\nto the primary side (P) of a step- down transformer. The  secondary side (S) of the transformer', 'is rectified and filtered. Then it is sent to the output of the power supply. A sample of this \\noutput is sent back as feedback for regulation as shown i n the above figure. \\n57  \\n Regulation \\n \\nThe output voltage is regulated by means of pulse width modu lation. In this the following \\nhappens \\n(i) When the output load increases, the output voltage falls. T he pulse width modulator \\ncontrol senses the change in the output voltage and increases  the ON time of the', 'transistor. This amount of voltage will be passed through the transformer. So the \\noutput will be maintained normally. \\n \\n \\n(ii) When the output voltage increases, the pulse width modulator control senses the \\nchange and decreases the ON time of the transistor.

The effectiveness \\nof a data communication system depends on three fundamental  characteristics:', '1. Delivery: The system must deliver data to the correct destination. Dat a must be \\nreceived by the intended device or user and only by that devi ce or user. \\n2. Accuracy: The system must deliver data accurately. Data that have altered in \\ntransmission and left uncorrected are unusable. \\n3. Timeliness: The system must deliver data in a timely manner. Data delive red late are \\nuseless. In the case of audio, video and voice data, timely delivery means delivering', 'data as they are produced. This kind of delivery is called rea l-time transmission. \\n \\n Components of a data communication: \\nA data communication is made up of five components. See fi gure below. \\n \\n \\nComponents of a data communication \\n \\n \\n1. Message: The message is the information (data) to be communicated. It can consist \\nof text, numbers, pictures, sound or video or any combination of these. \\n2. Sender: The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a computer,', 'workstation, telephone handset, video camera and so on.  \\n88  \\n 3. Receiver: The receiver is the device that receives the message. I t can be a computer, \\nworkstation, telephone handset, video camera and so on.  \\n4. Medium: The transmission medium is the physical path by which a message travels \\nfrom sender to receiver. It can consist of twisted pair  wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic \\ncable, laser or radio waves (terrestrial or satellite microwave).', '5. Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communicatio n. It represents \\nan agreement between the communicating devices. Without a protocol, two devices \\nmay be connected, but not communicating. \\n \\n \\n Data flow: \\nData flow or transmission mode is used to define the direction of signal flow between \\ntwo linked devices. There are three types of transmission modes: \\n1. Simplex \\n \\n2. Half duplex and \\n \\n3. Full duplex. \\n \\n \\n \\nTypes of transmission modes \\n Simplex:', 'Types of transmission modes \\n Simplex: \\nIn simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional. Only one of the two stations \\non a link can transmit and the other can only receive. See figure below. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSimplex \\nExample: Keyboard and monitor \\n89  \\n  Half duplex: \\nIn half duplex mode, each station can both transmit and r eceive, but not in the same \\ntime. When one device is sending, the other can only receive  and vice versa (See figure). In a', 'half duplex transmission mode, the entire capacity of a channel is taken over by the \\ntransmitting device. \\n \\n \\nHalf duplex \\n \\n \\nExample: Walkie-talkies. \\n \\n \\n Full duplex: \\nIn full duplex mode, also called duplex, both stations can tr ansmit and receive \\nsimultaneously. In this mode, signals going in either dir ection share the capacity of the link. \\nThis sharing can occur in two ways : either the link must c ontain two physically separate', 'transmission paths, one for sending and the other for r eceiving, or the capacity of the channel \\nis divided between the signals travelling in opposite directi ons. See figure below. \\n \\n \\nFull duplex \\n \\n \\nExample: Telephone network. \\n90  \\n  Topologies: \\nThe topology of a network is the geometric representation  of the relationship of all the \\nlinks and linking devices (usually called nodes) to each other. Ther e are four basic topologies \\npossible: bus, star, ring and mesh. See figure below.', 'Basic topologies \\nThese topologies describe how the devices in a network are  interconnected rather than \\ntheir physical arrangement. When choosing a topology, we have to consider the relative \\nstatus of the devices to be linked. i.e. whether the devices share the link equally (peer to peer) \\nor one device controls the traffic and others must transm it through it (primary-secondary). \\nRing and mesh topologies are peer to peer transmission, sta r is primary-secondary. A bus', 'topology is equally convenient for either. \\n Bus topology: \\nThe bus topology consists of computers connected by a sing le cable called a backbone \\nas in figure below. All the computers on the bus share in it s capacity. This is the simplest \\nmethod for connecting computers. In a bus environment, 10Ba se2 or 10Base5 cable is used, \\nand because all devices share the same bandwidth, the m ore devices, the slower the network.', 'In fact, it is probably not feasible for use with more than  10 workstations. \\nBus topology \\nIn a bus topology, the \\ncomputers only listen for data being \\nsent to them, they do not forward the \\ndata. This is called a passive topology . \\nA generated signal moves from one \\nend of the bus to the other end. To \\nprevent the signal from bouncing back \\nand forth, a terminator is located at \\neach end of the cable. \\nBecause all the computers are \\nconnected by the same cable, if one', 'connected by the same cable, if one \\nsegment has a problem, the whole \\nnetwork is down. \\n91  \\n Advantages : \\n1. Cabling is easy to work with and extend with less cost. \\n2. Less cabling because all computers are in one line. \\n3. Layout is simple. \\n \\n \\nDisadvantages: \\n1. Fault isolation is difficult because one break affects the entire netwo rk. \\n2. One break or bad termination brings down the entire network . \\n3. Heavy traffic can slow it down because all machines share same bandwidth.', 'Star topology: \\nIn star topology, the computers are connected to a centra lized hub by a cable segment \\nas in figure. They require more cabling than ring or bus topol ogies, but each computer is \\nconnected to the hub by its own cable. Therefore if one computer connection goes down, it \\ndoes not affect the rest of the network. Because each works tation has its own connection, it is \\nmuch easier to move them around or connect them to other networks. 10BaseT-100BaseFX', 'can be used a star topology. A star topology can support up to 1024 workstations, but it may \\nnot be feasible to connect them all to the same logica l network. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStar topology Advantages : \\n1. The entire network is not disrupted \\nwhen adding or removing computers. \\n2. If one computer fails, it does not affect \\nthe rest of the network. \\n3. It is easy to manage and monitor. \\nDisadvantages : \\n1. It requires more cabling because each \\nmachine needs a separate connection', 'machine needs a separate connection \\nto the central hub. \\n2. If the central hub fails, it brings down \\nthe entire network. \\n92  \\n  Ring topology: \\nIn ring topology, each computer connects directly to th e next one in line, forming a \\ncircle as shown in figure below. Data travels in a clockw ise direction and each computer \\naccepts the information intended for it and passes on th e information for other computers. It', 'uses a token, which is actually a small packet, to send information. Every  computer in the \\nring is responsible for either passing the token or creatin g a new one. Token passing uses the \\ntoken, or series of bits, to grant devicepermission to transmit o ver the network. When a \\ncomputer has information to send, it modifies the token an d passes it on. After the token \\nreaches its final destination, it lets the sender know it has arrived safely, the sender then', 'makes a new token, and the process starts over. Most ri ng networks use fiber or twisted pair \\nas the medium. \\nThis is known as active topology because each workstation is responsible for sending \\non the token. Currently many ring networks implement a dual- ring network or small hub to \\naddress this problem. \\nAdvantages: \\n1. Network performance is consistent due to token passing. \\n2. The length of the cable required is short. \\n3. Equal access is granted to all computers. \\nDisadvantages :', 'Disadvantages : \\n1. Unidirectional traffic. \\n2. If one computer fails, it brings down \\nthe entire network. \\n3. The entire network is disrupted when \\nadding or removing computers. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRing topology \\n \\n \\n Mesh topology: \\nIn a mesh topology, all devices are connected to each other  more than once to create \\nfault tolerance as in figure below. A single device or cable failure will not affect the \\nperformance because the devices are connected by more th an one means. This is more', 'expensive as it requires more hardware and cabling. This type o f topology can also be found \\nin enterprise –wide networks with routers connected to other routers for fault tolerance. \\n93  \\n So, a mesh topology is usually implemented in a limited fas hion, for example, as a \\nbackbone connecting the main computers of a hybrid netwo rk that can include several other \\ntopologies. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMesh topology Advantages : \\n1. The use of dedicated links guarantees', '1. The use of dedicated links guarantees \\nthat each connection can carry its own \\ndata load. \\n2. In mesh topology, if one link becomes \\nunusable, it does not affect the entire \\nsystem. \\n3. Another advantage is privacy or \\nsecurity. When every message sent \\ntravels along a dedicated line, only the \\nintended recipient sees it. \\n4. The point- to-point links make fault \\nidentification and fault isolation easy. \\n \\n \\nDisadvantages:', 'Disadvantages: \\n1. Because, every device must be connected to every other device, installation and \\nreconfiguration are difficult. \\n2. The sheer bulk of the wiring can be greater than the available space. \\n3. The hardware required to connect each link can be prohibitively expensive. \\n \\n \\n Hybrid topology: \\nA network that combines several other topologies as subne t works linked together in a \\nlarge topology. For instance, in star bus topology, computers are connected to hubs in a star', 'formation and then the hubs are connected via bus topolog y. Refer figure below. Although it \\nis more expensive to implement, longer distances can be covered and networks can be \\nisolated more easily. \\n94  \\n   \\n \\nstar bus topology star ring topology \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn a star ring topology , data is sent in a circular motion around the star. R efer figure \\nabove. This eliminates the single point of failure that ca n occur in a ring topology. It uses', 'token passing data transmission with the physical layout of a star. \\nLarge networks are typically organized as hierarchies. A hier archical organization \\nprovides advantages such as ease of management, flexibility  and a reduction in unnecessary \\ntraffic. In a hierarchical network structure, a high-speed bac kbone of Fiber optic cable usually \\nconnects the servers. \\n \\nAdvantages: \\n1. Fault detection and trouble shooting is easy. \\n2. It is easy to add new devices or network. \\n \\n \\nDisadvantages:', 'Disadvantages: \\n1. It is difficult to design. \\n2.

When computers communicate with each other,  they can share resources. These \\nresources can be data, applications or hardware. We can con nect two computers together with \\na cable, which results in a simple network. \\n Types of Networks: \\nThere are primarily three categories of networks namely L ocal Area Networks (LAN),', 'Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN). T he category of a \\nnetwork is determined by its size, ownership, the distance it covers and its physical \\narchitecture. \\n \\n \\n \\nTypes of Networks \\n96  \\n  LAN: \\nA local area network (LAN) is usually owned and links the devices in a single office, \\nbuilding or campus. \\n \\n \\n \\nDepending on the needs of an organization and type of technol ogy used, a LAN can', 'be as simple as 2 PCs and a printer in someone’s home o ffice or it can extend throughout  \\ncompan yand include voice sound and video peripherals. Currently LAN’s  size is limited to  \\nfew kilometres. \\nLANs are designed to allow resources to be shared between PCs  or workstations. The \\nresources to be shared can include hardware (e.g. a printer),  software (e.g. a application \\nprogram) or data. \\nIn addition to size, LANs are distinguished from other types  of networks by their', 'transmission media and topology. In general, a given LAN will use only one type of \\ntransmission medium. The most common LAN topologies ar e bus, ring and star. \\nTraditionally, LANs have data rates in 4 to 16 Mbps range. Today, the speeds are \\nincreasing and can reach 100 Mbps with gigabit systems in de velopment. \\n \\n MAN: \\nA Metropolitan area network (MAN) is designed to extend over  an entire city. It may', 'be a single network such as a cable television network or it may be a means of connecting a \\nnumber of LANs into a large network so that resources may be shared LAN- to-LAN as well \\nas device- to-device. For example, a company can use MAN to connect the LANs in all its \\noffices throughout a city. \\n97  \\n  \\n \\nMetropolitan area network \\nA MAN can be wholly owned and operated by a private company or  it may be a \\nservice provided by a public company such as a local telephone company. \\n WAN:', 'WAN: \\nA wide area network (WAN) provides long distance transmissio n of data, voice, \\nimage and video information over large geographical areas tha t may comprise a country, \\ncontinent or even the whole world. \\nIn contrast to LANs (depend on their own hardware for transmi ssion), WANs may utilize \\npublic, leased or private communication devices, usually in com binations and can therefore \\nspan unlimited number of miles. A WAN that is wholly owned and used by single company', 'is often referred to as an enterprise network. \\n \\n \\nWide area network \\n98  \\n In addition to the above three categories of network, a user can use other types of \\nnetworks as required by his application.

Their packet-forwarding decisions', 'are based on MAC addresses. That is, a switch simply looks  at each packet and determines \\nfrom a physical address (MAC address) which device a packet i s intended for and then \\nswitches it out toward that device. \\nSwitches allow LANs to be segmented, thereby increasing t he amount of bandwidth \\nthat goes to each device.

A router may create or maintain a tabl e of the available routes and their \\nconditions and then use this information along with dis tance and cost algorithms to determine \\nthe best route for a given packet. \\n105  \\n  \\n \\n \\nRouter \\n \\n \\nOn the Internet, a router is a device that determines th e next network point to which a', 'packet should be forwarded toward its destination. The router is connected to at least two \\nnetworks and decides which way to send each information packet based on its current \\nunderstanding of the state of the networks to which it is conn ected. \\nA router is located at any gateway, including each interne t point of presence. Many \\ntimes the connection from a router to the internet is through a device called Channel Service', 'Unit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU). The router is then internal, connected to a LAN port on \\na switch. \\n \\nTypes of routers: \\nRouters are divided into two categories:  \\n1. Wired and \\n2. Wireless. \\n \\n \\nWired Routers:  \\nWired routers can be used to do several different types of things. They can be used to \\nconnect two different computers or to connect two computers  to the Internet. They can also \\nbe used to create a phone connection. If we are using Voice  over IP (VoIP) technology, then', 'we will need a broadband router to connect Internet to phone. These are often a special type \\nof modem that will have both Ethernet and phone jacks. Us ually we must purchase the router \\nfrom the company in order to obtain the service.  \\n106  \\n Wireless Routers:  \\nWireless routers connect to the modem and create a wir eless signal in home or office. \\nSo, any computer within range can connect to the wireless ro uter and use broadband Internet', 'for free. The only way to keep anyone from connecting to the system is to secure the router \\nby using the security key.  \\n \\n \\n Gateways: \\nGateways potentially operate in all seven layers of the OSI model. A gateway is a \\nprotocol converter. A route by itself transfers, accepts a nd relays packets only across \\nnetworks using similar protocols. A gateway on the other hand c an accept a packet formatted \\nfor one protocol (e.g. AppleTalk) and convert it to a packet fo rmatted for another protocol', '(e.g. TCP/IP) before forwarding it. \\nA gateway is generally software installed within a router.  The gateway understands \\nthe protocols used by each network linked to the router and is th erefore able to translate from \\none to another. In some cases, the only modification nec essary are the header and trailer of \\nthe packet. In other cases, the gateway must adjust the data  rate, size and format as well.

Proprietary \\n2. Nonproprietary. \\n \\n \\nProprietary standards are those originally invented by a commercial organization as \\na basis for the operation of its products.

In 1984, the ISO architecture became an international \\nstandard known as the Open System Interconnection (OSI)reference model . This \\narchitecture determines how the hardware, software, topolog ies and protocols exist and \\noperate on a network. The OSI model is based on seven layers as in figure. \\nEach layer adds functionality to the previous layer and com municates with layers', 'directly above and below it.

The conventions developed by ARPA to specify how i ndividual computers could', 'communicate across that network became TCP/IP. The adapt ability of TCP/IP and expansion \\nof ARPANET became the backbone of today’s  Internet. \\n \\n TCP/IP: \\nThe Transmission Control Protocol/Internetworking Protocol is a set or protocols or a \\nprotocol suite that defines how all transmissions are exchan ged across the internet. \\n \\nTCP/IP and the Internet: \\nAn internet under TCP/IP operates like a single network co nnecting many computers', 'of any size and type. Internally the Internet is an int erconnection of independent physical \\nnetworks linked together by internetworking devices. Figure shoes the topology of a possible \\ninternet. In this example, the letters A, B, C and so  on represent hosts. A host in TCP/IP is a \\ncomputer. The solid circles in the figure numbered 1, 2, 3 a nd so on are routers or gateways. \\nThe larger ovals containing numerals represent separate physical networks. \\n \\n \\nTCP/IP and the Internet', 'TCP/IP and the Internet \\nTCP/IP considers all interconnected physical networks to be one huge network. It \\nconsiders all the hosts to be connected to this larger logi cal network rather than to other \\nindividual physical networks. \\n116  \\n TCP/IP and OSI : \\nTCP/IP’s implementation of the OSI model makes functiona lity simpler by mapping  \\nthe same seven layers of the OSI model to a four layer mo del. Unlike the OSI reference', 'model, the TCP/IP model focuses more on delivering the internet connectivity than on \\nfunctional layers. It does this by acknowledging the import ance of a structured hierarchical \\nsequence of functions, yet leaves the protocol designers with the flexi bility for \\nimplementation. The OSI reference model is much better at explaining the mechanics of \\nintercomputer communications, but because TCP/IP has beco me the internetworking model \\nof choice, this model is more commonly used.', 'of choice, this model is more commonly used. \\nThe table below compares the OSI and TCP/IP models. \\n \\n \\nOSI Reference model TCP/IP Networking model \\nApplication layer  \\nApplication Layer Presentation Layer \\nSession Layer \\nTransport Layer Transport Layer \\nNetwork Layer Internet Layer \\nData Link Layer \\nNetwork Interface Layer \\nPhysical Layer \\n \\nComparison of OSI reference model and TCP/IP Networking model \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Application Layer: Maps to Layer 5 (Session), Layer 6 (Presentation) and La yer 7', '(Application) of the OSI model. This is how applications and certain services access \\nthe network. \\n\\uf0b7 Transport Layer: Maps to Layer 4 (Transport) of the OSI model. It accepts da ta and \\nsegments it for transport across the network, making s ure that the data is delivered \\nerror-free and in the proper sequence. \\n\\uf0b7 Internet Layer:   Maps to Layer 3 (Network) of the OSI model. It manages the \\nrouting of packets that are to be forwarded on to different networks, relying on', 'routable protocols for delivery. \\n\\uf0b7 Network Access Layer: Maps to Layer 1 (physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link) of the \\nOSI model. It is responsible for the delivery of datagrams by  creating a frame for the \\nnetwork type and then sending the data to the wire. \\n117  \\n TCP/IP is a suite of protocols and applications that enable  a computer to communicate \\nwith other computers in a network. It doesn’t matter what opera ting system the computers are', 'using as long as each system supports TCP/IP. The computers then communicate and share \\ninformation. \\n \\n Connection oriented and Connectionless Services: \\nA transport layer protocol can either be connectionless o r connection-oriented. \\n \\n \\nConnectionless service: \\nIn a connectionless service, the packets are sent from o ne computer to another with no \\nneed for connection establishment and connection relea se. The packets are not numbered.', 'They may be delayed, lost or arrive out of sequence. The re is no acknowledgment either. \\nUDP  is a connectionless protocol. \\n \\nConnection oriented Service: \\nIn a connection-oriented service, a connection is firs t established between the sender \\nand the receiver. Then, data are transferred. At the end,  the connection is released. TCP is a \\nconnection-oriented protocol. \\n \\n \\n Sockets: \\nA socket is an internal end point for sending/receiving at a single node in a computer', 'network. Two processes need a socket at each end to commu nicate with each other. \\n \\n \\nSocket structure \\n \\n \\nThe above figure shows a simplified socket structure. The  fields are discussed below: Remote socket address Local socket address Protocol Type Family \\n118  \\n \\uf0b7 Family : This field is used for defining the protocol group such as IPv4 or IPv6, Unix \\ndomain protocol etc. \\n\\uf0b7 Type : This field is used for defining the type of socket such as stream socket, packet \\nsocket or raw socket.', 'socket or raw socket. \\n\\uf0b7 Protocol : This field is usually set to zero for TCP and UDP. \\n\\uf0b7 Local socket address : It is used for defining the local socket address. This address is  \\na combination of local IP address and the port address of the local application \\nprogram. \\n\\uf0b7 Remote socket address : It is used for defining the remote socket address which is a \\ncombination of remote IP address and the port address of th e remote application \\nprogram. \\n \\nSocket types:', 'program. \\n \\nSocket types: \\nThe socket interface defines three types of sockets: \\n1. Stream socket \\n2. Packet socket and \\n3. Raw socket \\n \\n \\nAll these sockets are used in TCP/IP environment. Let us dis cuss them one by one. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStream socket: \\nThis is designed for the connection oriented protocol such as TCP. The TCP uses a \\npair of stream sockets for connecting one application program to the other across the Internet. \\n119  \\n Datagram socket:', '119  \\n Datagram socket: \\nThis type of socket is designed for the connectionless protoc ol such as UDP. UDP \\nuses a pair of datagram sockets for sending a message from one application program to \\nanother across the internet. \\nRaw socket: \\nRaw sockets are designed for the protocols such as ICMP, be cause these protocols do \\nnot use either stream packets or datagram sockets. \\n \\n TCP/IP Transport layer’s  Protocols:', 'TCP/IP Transport layer’s  Protocols: \\nThe protocol layer above the Internet layer is the Trans port layer. It is responsible for \\nproviding end- to-end data integrity. It also provides a reliable communica tion service so that \\nan extended two-way conversation may take place. \\nIt consists of two protocols TCP and UDP. \\n \\nTCP provides connection oriented data transmission, can support multiple data \\nstreams and provides for flow and error control. It uses sequence numbers and', 'acknowledgments to guarantee delivery. UDP  does not provide either sequencing or \\nacknowledgements. It is a connectionless protocol that is u sed in telephony traffic and the \\nRemote Procedure Call (RPC). \\nThe major difference between TCP and UDP is reliability. TCP is highly reliable and \\nUDP  is a best effort simple delivery method. One of the main functions of TCP and UDP  is \\nas a port manager for the applications that are in the top layer. The destination port number is', 'placed in the header and is used to pass traffic to the cor rect application. \\n \\n \\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP): \\nTCP is the part of the protocol suite that provides functi onality for packets and error \\nchecking. Applications that require reliable data delivery u se TCP because it verifies that data \\nare delivered accurately and in the proper sequence. It also ensures that data are resubmitted \\nwhen transmission results in an error and also enables hosts to maintain multiple,', 'simultaneous connections. \\nSockets make up a TCP connection. A socket consists of a n IP address and a port \\nnumber. Connections are determined by the IP addresses and the socket numbers of the two \\ncomputers trying to communicate. To establish a connection,  a machine needs to know the IP \\naddress and the port number on which the application communic ates. When the application \\nfirst starts using TCP, the receiver’s computer sets up a  buff er large enough to accommodate', 'traffic for the data from the application. An acknowledgement (ACK) is periodically sent to \\n120  \\n the sender. If TCP receives ACKs that indicate a missi ng segment, it resends the missing \\nsegment and any segments sent after that to ensure that  all the data was sent. The two TCP \\nend points hold state information that in essence forms a virtual circuit. The virtual circuit is \\nfull duplex, meaning that data can go in both directions simu ltaneously. This virtual circuit', 'consumes resources in both TCP endpoints; therefore it  requires more CPU and network \\nbandwidth. \\n \\n \\nThe two most typical network applications that use TCP are File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and \\nTelnet. Telnet uses port 23 and FTP uses port 21. Clients ca n find the desired server simply \\nby connecting to port 23 or 21 of TCP on the specified computer . The TCP protocol header is \\nillustrated if figure below. \\n \\n \\n \\nTCP protocol header', 'TCP protocol header \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe TCP protocol header is a minimum of 20 octets and con tains the following fields \\n:. \\n\\uf0b7 Source port : This that contains the port number of the application requesting the \\nconnection. \\n\\uf0b7 Destination port : This contains the port number of the application called in the \\nconnection. \\n\\uf0b7 Sequence number : This is used to reconstruct the data back into its original form at \\nthe destination number. \\n121', 'the destination number. \\n121  \\n \\uf0b7 Acknowledgement number : This identifies each sequence number of the packet \\nbeing acknowledged.

It merely pushes the datagram out and acc epts incoming \\ndatagram. UDP adds to what IP provides by multiplexing information  between application \\nbased on port number. In other words, UDP gives application programs direct access to a \\ndatagram via ports. This direct access allows applications  to exchange messages over the \\nnetwork with a minimum of protocol overhead. \\nIf the amount of data being transmitted is small, the ov erhead of creating connections', 'and ensuring reliable delivery may be greater than the work o f retransmitting the entire \\ndatagram. Other applications provide their own techniques for re liable data delivery and do \\nnot require that service from the Transport layer protocol . Imposing another layer of \\n122  \\n acknowledgement is redundant. Some applications have a query/r esponse mechanism. The \\nresponse can be used as an acknowledgement to the query the reby verifying the connection.', 'UDP can also be used for exchanges of data that do not requir e any of the functionality that \\nTCP provides. The UDP protocol header is given in figure below  \\n \\n.  \\nUDP protocol header \\n \\n \\nThe fields are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Source port number: This contains the port number of the application requesting the \\nconnection. \\n\\uf0b7 Destination port number: This contains the port number of the application called in \\nthe connection.', 'the connection. \\n\\uf0b7 Message length: It defines the length of the user datagram, header plus data.  \\n\\uf0b7 Checksum: It is field used to detect errors over the entire user datagr am. \\nExample network applications that use UDP are Network F ile System (NFS) and Simple \\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP). \\n \\nApplications of UDP: \\nThe following are some uses of UDP. \\n1. UDP is suitable for a process that requires simple request- response communication', 'with little concern for flow and error control. It is not usually used for a process that \\nneeds to send bulk data, such as FTP. \\n2. UDP is suitable for process with internal flow and error control mechanisms. For \\nexample, the Trivial File Transport Protocol (TFTP) include s flow and error control. \\nIt can easily use UDP. \\n123  \\n 3. UDP  is a suitable transport protocol for multicasting. Multicas ting capabilities are \\nembedded in the UDP software but not in the TCP software.', '4. UDP  is used for some routing update protocols such as Routing Information Protocol \\n(RIP). \\n \\nComparison of TCP and UDP: \\n \\nS.No. TCP UDP  \\n1. Applications that send continuous streams \\nof data at a steady rate use TCP. Applications that do not want a \\ncontinuous flow but send data \\noccasionally in the form of bursts use \\nUDP  \\n2.

When a node has data to tra nsmit, it first listens on the cable', 'using a transceiver to check whether a signal is being transm itted by another node. This is \\ndone by monitoring the current flowing in the cable. Data is transmitted when there is no \\n124  \\n current present and the physical medium is idle. CSMA is  a fundamental advance in access \\nand performance because it check whether the medium is active before sending a packet. If \\nthe channel is sensed as isle, it transmits. If the cha nnel is sensed as busy, it holds off the', 'transmission until it can sense that the medium is idl e. \\nAt a time, if two stations are waiting to transmit, they wi ll send, as soon as each sense \\nthe medium is idle, causing a collision. Obviously, if a collision happens, we want to detect \\nand resolve it. The method that can be used to solve col lision issues is exponential backoff. In \\nthis method, when a collision occurs, a timeout is randomly  chosen and the transmission \\nresumes/backoff after timeout.', 'resumes/backoff after timeout. \\nDuring this process, the node must continuously monitor the c ollision detection logic \\nto detect whether a collision occurs. If it does, it stops sending bits within a few bit periods , \\nstarts the collision procedure by sending a jam signal, and then calculates a retransmission \\ntime. This causes the other nodes to discard the frame a nd ensure that all stations are aware of \\na collision so that they can increment a timeout range. \\nCollision in CSMA/CD \\n125', 'Collision in CSMA/CD \\n125  \\n Frame format: \\nIEEE 802.3 specifies one type of frame containing seven fi elds: Preample, SFD, DA, \\nSA, length/type of PDU, 802.2 frame and the CRC.

Fast Ethernet 2.  Gigabit Ethernet.', '1. Fast Ethernet 2.  Gigabit Ethernet. \\n \\n \\nFast Ethernet: \\nWith new applications such as CAD, image processing and real  time audio and video \\nbeing implemented on LANs, there is a need for a LAN with a data rate higher than 10 Mbps. \\nFast Ethernet is a version of Ethernet with a 100 Mbps  data rate. There is no change in the \\nframe format and in the access method. The only two ch anges in the MAC layer are the data', 'rate and the collision domain. The data rate is increased by a factor of 10. \\n \\nIn the physical layer, IEEE has designed two categories of Fast Ethernet: \\n \\n \\n1. 100Base-X and \\n2. 100Base-T4. \\n130  \\n The first uses two cables between the station and the h ub. The second one uses four. \\n100Base-X itself is divided into two types: \\n \\n1. 100Base- TX and \\n2. 100Base- FX \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCategories of Fast Ethernet implementations \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n100Base- TX :', '100Base- TX : \\nThe 100Base-TX uses two category 5 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)  or two shielded \\ntwisted-pair (STP) cables to connect a station to the hub. One pair is used to carry frames \\nfrom the station to the hub and the other to carry frames from hub to the station. The \\nencoding is 4B/5B to handle the 100 Mbps, the signaling is NRZ-I.  The distance between the \\nstation and the hub should be less than 100 meters. \\n \\n100Base- FX :', '100Base- FX : \\nThis design uses two optical fibers, one to carry frames from the station to the hub \\nand the other from the hub to the station. The encodin g is 4B/5B and signaling is NRZ-I. The \\ndistance between the station and the hub (or switch) sho uld be less than 2000 meters. \\n \\n \\n \\n100Base- T4 : \\nThis scheme was designed in an effort to avoid rewiring.

Two of the four pairs are bidirectional and the oth er two are unidirectional. This \\nmeans that in each direction, three pairs are used at the same time to carry data. Because a \\n100 Mbps data rate cannot be handled by a voice grade UTP, t he specification splits the 100', 'Mbps flow of data into three 33.66Mbps flows. To reduce the b aud rate of transmission, a \\nmethod called 8B/6T is used in which each block of 8 bits is transformed into 6 bauds of \\nthree voltage levels (positive, negative and zero). \\n \\nGigabit Ethernet : \\nThe migration from 10Mbps to 100 Mbps encourages the IEEE802.3 com mittee to \\ndesign Gigabit Ethernet, which has a data rate of 1000 Mbps or  1 Gbps. The strategy is the', 'same. The MAC layer and the access method remain the sa me, but the collision domain is \\nreduced. In the physical layer, the transmission media an d the encoding system change. \\nGigabit Ethernet is mainly designed to use optical fiber, a lthough the protocol does not \\neliminate the use of twisted pair cables.

However, IP needs t he services of other protocols. \\n134  \\n IP needs a protocol called ARP to find the MAC (physical) addre ss of the next hop. \\nThis address must be passed to the data link layer, with the I P datagram, to be inserted into \\nthe encapsulating frame. \\nDuring datagram delivery, IP needs the services of ICMP to han dle unusual situations \\nsuch as the occurrence of an error.', 'such as the occurrence of an error. \\nIP is designed for unicast delivery, one source to destinatio n. Multimedia and other \\nnew applications in the Internet need multicasting deliver y, one source to many destinations. \\nFor multicasting, IP uses the services of another protocol called IGMP. \\n \\n \\n \\nIntroduction: \\nThe Internet is made of a combination of physical networ ks connected by devices \\nsuch as routers. A packet starting from a source host ma y pass through several different', 'physical networks before finally reaching the destination ho st. \\n \\nIP address: \\nThe hosts and routers are recognized at the network leve l by their IP addresses. An IP \\naddress is an internetwork address. \\n \\nMAC address: \\nAt the physical network, the hosts and routers are recogni zed by their MAC \\naddresses. A MAC address is a local address. Its jurisdict ion is a local network \\nThe delivery of a packet to a host or a router requires t wo levels of addressing : IP', 'address and MAC address. Two protocols are used to find the othe r address if one type of \\naddress is known. \\nThey are \\n1. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and \\n2. Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) \\n \\n \\nThe ARP maps an IP address to a MAC address, whereas the RARP maps a MAC address to \\nan IP address. \\n \\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP): \\nThe Address Resolution Protocol associates an IP address with the MAC address. On', 'a typical physical network, such as a LAN, each device on a link is identified by a physical or \\nstation address usually imprinted on the network interface car d (NIC). \\n135  \\n Anytime a host or a router needs to find the physical address of  another host on the \\nnetwork, it sends an ARP query packet. The packet includes the physical and IP address of \\nthe sender and the IP address of the receiver. Because the sender does not know the physical', 'address of the receiver, the query is broadcast over the  network. See figure below. \\nEvery host or router on the network receives and proces ses the ARP packet, but only \\nthe intended recipient recognizes its internet address an d sends back an ARP response packet. \\nThe response packet contains the recipient’s IP and physica l addresses. The packet is unicast  \\ndirectly to the inquirer using the physical address received in the query packet.', 'In the figure below, the system on the left (A) has a packet that need to be delivered to \\nanother system (B) with IP address 141.23.56.23. System A need s to pass the packet to its \\ndata link layer for the actual delivery, but it does not kno w the physical address of the \\nrecipient. It uses the services of ARP to send an ARP reque st packet to ask for the physical \\naddress of a system with an IP address of 141.23.56.23.', 'This packet is received by every system on the physical ne twork, but only system B \\nwill answer it as in figure. System B sends an ARP reply packet that includes its physical \\n136  \\n address. Now system A can send all the packets to this destinati on using the physical address \\nit received. \\n \\nReverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP): \\nThe Reverse Address Resolution Protocol allows a host to discover its internet', 'address when it knows only its physical address. A host is suppo sed to have its internet \\naddress stored on its hard disk. So, this will be in the ca se of diskless computer or computer is \\nbeing connected ti the network for the first time or a new computer with old NIC. \\nRARP works much like ARP. The host wising to retrieve its internet address \\nbroadcasts an RARP query packet that contains its physical address to every host on its', 'physical network. A server on the network recognizes the RARP packet and returns the host’s  \\ninternet address. \\n \\n \\n \\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): \\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) provides unreliable and connec tionless datagram delivery. \\nHowever, it has two deficiencies : lack of error control and lack of assistance mechanisms. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) has been designed to compensate', 'for the above two deficiencies. It is a companion to the I P. ICMP itself is a network layer \\nprotocol. However, the messages are not passed directly to the data link layer. Instead, the \\nmessages are first encapsulated inside IP datagrams befor e going to the lower layer as in \\nfigure above. \\nThe value of the protocol field in the IP datagram is 1 to indicate that the IP data are \\nan ICMP message. \\n137  \\n Applications:', 'an ICMP message. \\n137  \\n Applications: \\nThe ping command uses ICMP as a probe to test whether a station i s reachable. Ping \\npackages an ICMP echo request message in a datagram and sends it to the selected \\ndestination. The user chooses the destination by specifying its IP address on the command \\nline in a form such as \\nping 100.50.25.1 \\n \\nWhen the destination receives the echo request messages,  it responds by sending an', 'ICMP echo reply message. If a reply is not returned within a set time, ping regards the echo \\nrequest several more times. If no reply arrives, ping indicates that the destination is \\nunreachable. \\nAnother utility that uses ICMP is tracert (trace route), which provides a list of all the \\nrouters along the path to a specified destination. \\nFive types of errors are handled by ICMP. The five error reporting messages are given \\nbelow. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nInternet Group Message Protocol (IGMP):', 'Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP): \\nThe IP protocol can be involved in two types of communicati on : unicasting and \\nmulticasting. Unicasting is the communication between one  sender and one receiver. It is a \\none-to-one communication. However, sometimes, processes need to send the same message \\nto a large number of users simultaneously. This is called mu lticasting, which is a one- to- \\nmany communication.', 'many communication. \\nIP addressing supports multicasting. All 32-bit addresses that start with 1110 (class D) \\nare multicast addresses. With 28 bits remaining for the gro up address, more than 250 million \\naddresses are available for assignment. \\nThe Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP) is a companion of the IP protocol. It is \\na protocol that manages group membership. In any network, there are one or more multicast \\n138', '138  \\n routers that distribute multicast packets to hosts or other routers. IGMP gives multicast \\nrouters information about the membership status of hosts or routers connected to the network. \\nA multicast router may receive thousands of multicast pa ckets every day for different \\ngroups. If a router has no knowledge about the membership status  of the hosts, it must \\nbroadcast all these packets. This creates a lot of traff ic and consumes a lot of bandwidth.

Even, a mid size organizati on may need more addresses. \\nOne solution is supernetting. In supernetting, an organization can combine several \\nclass C blocks to create a larger range of addresses. In oth er words, several networks are \\ncombined to create a supernetwork. By doing this, an organizati on can apply for a set of class', 'C blocks instead of just one.

For exam ple, \\n \\n \\n1. Two systems may use different file name conventions. \\n2. Two systems may have different ways to represent text a nd data.', '3. Two systems may have different directory structures. \\n \\n \\nAll these problems have been solved by FTP in a very simpl e and elegant approach. \\n \\nFTP differs from other client-server applications in that it establishes two connections \\nbetween the hosts. One connection is used for data trans fer, the other for control informations \\n(commands and responses). Separation of commands and data  transfer makes FTP more', 'efficient. The control connection uses simple rules of  communication. We need to transfer \\nonly a line of command or a line of response at a time. The data connection on the other \\nhand, needs more complex rules due to the variety of dat a types transferred. \\nFTP uses two well known TCP ports : \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Port 21 is used for the control connection and \\n\\uf0b7 Port 20 is used for the data connection. \\n \\nThe following figure shows the basic model of FTP. \\n \\nFTP \\n146  \\n The client has three components :', 'FTP \\n146  \\n The client has three components : \\n\\uf0b7 the user interface \\n\\uf0b7 the client control process and \\n\\uf0b7 the client data transfer process \\n \\nThe server has two components : \\n\\uf0b7 the server control process and \\n\\uf0b7 the server data transfer process. \\nThe control connection is made between the control proce sses. The data connection is \\nmade between the data transfer processes. \\nThe control connection remains connected during the entire  interactive FTP session. The', 'data connection is opened and then closed for each file transferred. It opens each time \\ncommands that involve transferring files are used, and i t closes when the file is transferred.

It has an \\nenvelope and a message. \\n \\nEnvelope : \\nThe envelope usually contains the sender address, the rece iver address and other \\ninformation. \\n \\nMessage :', 'information. \\n \\nMessage : \\nThe message usually contains the headers and the body. The headers of the message \\ndefine the sender, the receiver, the subject of the messa ge and other information. The body of \\nthe message contains the actual information to be read by the recipient. \\n \\nReceiving Mail : \\nThe email system periodically checks the mailboxes. If a  user has mail, it informs the \\nuser with a notice. If the user is ready to read the ma il, a list is displayed in which each line', 'contains a summary of the information about a particul ar message in the mailbox. The \\nsummary usually includes the sender mail address, the subjec t and the time the mail was sent \\nor received. The user can select any of the messages and d isplay its contents on the screen. \\n \\nAddresses : \\nTo deliver mail, a mail handling system must use an addressing s ystem with unique \\naddresses. The addressing system used by SMTP consists of two parts : a local part and a', 'domain name, separated by an @ sign. \\nSee figure below. \\n \\n \\nAddress of the  The domain name \\nmail box on the of the destination \\nlocal site \\nEmail address \\nExample : ramesh1998@gmail.com \\n \\n \\nLocal Part : \\nThe local part defines the name of a special file called user mailbox. local part domain name \\n150  \\n Domain Name : \\nThe second part of the address is the domain name.

The protocol transfers data in the fo rm of plain text, hypertext, audio,', 'video and so on. It is called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol because it is used in an \\nenvironment where there are rapid jumps from one document  to another. \\n Universal Resource Locator (URL) : \\nThe World Wide Web uses Universal Resource Locators (URL) to r epresent hyper \\nmedia links and links to network services within HTML documents . It is possible to represent \\nalmost any file or service on the Internet with a URL. A URL looks like : \\nhttp://www.miocrosoft.com \\n153', 'http://www.miocrosoft.com \\n153  \\n Port Host The first part of the URL (before two slashes) specifies  the method of access. The \\nsecond is typically the address of the computer on which th e information or service is to be \\nlocated. Further parts may specify the name of files, the port to connect to, or text to search \\nfor in a database. A URL is always a single line with no embedded spaces. \\nThe URL defines four things : Method, Host computer, Port and Path. The figure', 'below shows the body of a URL. \\n \\n:// : / \\n \\n \\nURL (Uniform Resource Locator) \\n\\uf0b7 The method is the protocol used to retrieve the document, for example HT TP. \\n\\uf0b7 The host is the computer where the information is located, although  the name of \\nthe computer can be an alias.

Arts \\nand rec were proposed to accommodate organizations such as art museum s and recreational', 'web sites; while nom was proposed to permit individuals to register their names. For many \\nreasons, however, the new names have not received offici al approval. \\nWhen an organization wants to participate in domain name sy stem, the organization \\nmust apply for a name under one of the existing top-level domains. For example, a \\ncorporation named “Videsh Sanchar Nigam  Limited” might request the domain vsnl under', 'the top-level domain com. If it approves the request, th e Internet authority responsible for \\ndomain names will assign the domain : \\n \\nvsnl.com \\nOnce an organization has been assigned a domain, the suff ix is reserved for the \\norganization : no other organization will be assigned the sa me name suffix. To obtain a \\ndomain, an organization must register with the Internet authority.  A unique domain suffix is \\nassigned to each organization. \\nCountry domains :', 'Country domains : \\nThe country domain section follows the same format as t he generic domains but uses \\ntwo character country abbreviations (e.g. in for India).

Motherboard \\n \\nBelow is a list of external hardware and internal hardware and the categories of \\nhardware that may be found with a computer \\nExternal hardware examples \\n\\uf0b7 Flat-panel, Monitor, and LCD \\n\\uf0b7 Keyboard \\n\\uf0b7 Microphone \\n\\uf0b7 Mouse \\n\\uf0b7 Printer \\n\\uf0b7 Projector \\n\\uf0b7 Scanner \\n\\uf0b7 Speakers \\n\\uf0b7 USB thumb drive \\nInternal hardware examples \\n\\uf0b7 Processor (CPU) \\n\\uf0b7 Drive (e.g. Blu-ray, CD-ROM, DVD , floppy drive, hard drive, and SSD) \\n\\uf0b7 Fan (heat sink) \\n\\uf0b7 Modem \\n\\uf0b7 Motherboard \\n\\uf0b7 Network card \\n\\uf0b7 RAM \\n\\uf0b7 Sound card \\n\\uf0b7 Video card \\n \\n SOFTWARE \\nSoftware is a collection of instructions that enable the user to in teract with a \\ncomputer, its hardware, or perform tasks. \\nSoftware is often divided into two categories. \\n1. Systems software : It includes the operating system and all \\nthe utilities that enable the computer to \\nfunction. \\nFor Example: Windows xp/7/8/8.1/10, Ms- \\nDOS, Ubuntu, Apple \\n6  \\n 2. Applications software : It includes programs that do real work for users. \\n \\nFor example: word processors, spreadsheets. \\n \\nDifference between Hardware and Software: \\n \\nSl. \\nNo. Hardware Software \\n1 Physical parts of the computer are called hardware A set of instructions given to the computer \\nis called software \\n2 We can see, touch and feel hardware We cannot touch and feel software \\n3 Hardware is constructed using physical materials \\nor components Software is developed by writing \\ninstructions in programming language \\n4 Hardware cannot be transferred from one place to \\nanother electronically through network Software can be transferred from one place \\nto another electronically through network \\n5 User cannot make new duplicate copies of the \\nhardware User can make many new duplicate copies \\nof the software \\n \\n Firmware \\nFirmware is a software program or set of instructions pro grammed on a hardware \\ndevice. It provides the necessary instructions for how the device com municates with the other \\ncomputer hardware. Firmware is typically stored in the flash ROM of a hardware device. \\nWhile ROM is \"read-only memory,\" flash ROM can be erased and rewritten because it is \\nactually a type of flash memory. \\nExample: \\nEmbedded Systems, computers, computer peripherals, mobile ph ones, and digital cameras. \\n \\n Motherboard \\nA motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a c omputer system. It is also \\ncalled as printed circuit board , system board , baseboard , planar board or logic board. \\nThe large PCB of a motherboard may include 6 -14 layers of fiberglass, copper connecting \\ntraces and copper planes for power and signal isolation. Additional components can be added \\nto a motherboard through its expansion slots. \\nHere are some of the typical parts: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 A CPU socket - the actual CPU is directly soldered onto the  socket. Since high speed \\nCPUs generate a lot of heat, there are heat sinks and mo unting points for fans right \\nnext to the CPU socket. \\n\\uf0b7 A power connector to distribute power to the CPU and other c omponents. \\n\\uf0b7 Slots for the system\\'s main memory, typically in the form of DRAM chips. \\n\\uf0b7 A chip forms an interface between the CPU, the main mem ory and other components. \\nOn many types of motherboards, this is referred to as the Northbridge. This chip also \\ncontains a large heat sink. \\n\\uf0b7 A second chip controls the input and output (I/O) functions . It is not connected \\ndirectly to the CPU but to the Northbridge. This I/O controller  is referred to as the \\nSouthbridge. The Northbridge and Southbridge   combined   are    referred   to   as \\nthe chipset . \\n\\uf0b7 Several connectors, which provide the physical interface betwe en input and output \\ndevices and the motherboard. The Southbridge handles these  connections. \\n7  \\n \\uf0b7 Slots for one or more hard drives to store files. The most common types of \\nconnections are Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) and Ser ial Advanced Technology \\nAttachment (SATA). \\n\\uf0b7 A Read-Only Memory (ROM) chip, which contains the firmware , or startup \\ninstructions for the computer system. This is also calle d the BIOS. \\n\\uf0b7 A slot for a video or graphics card. There are a number of different types of slots, \\nincluding the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and Peripheral  Component \\nInterconnect Express (PCIe). \\n\\uf0b7 Additional slots to connect \\nInterconnect (PCI) slots hardware in the form of Peripheral Component \\n\\uf0b7 Additional slots to connect \\nInterconnect (PCI) slots hardware in the form of Peripheral Component \\n \\n \\n \\n Input Output: \\nThe ports on the outside of a computer are commonly referre d to as \"I/O ports\" \\nbecause they are the ones that connect input and output device s to the computer. It also refers \\nto as I/O address, I/O ports, and I/O port address, and the input/ou tput port is allows the \\nsoftware drivers to communicate with hardware devices on your  computer. \\n \\n \\n Expansion slots: \\nExpansion slots provided on the motherboard are used to con nect daughter boards. By \\nconnecting the necessary daughter boards we can expand the system. The following are the \\nimportant expansion slots present on the motherboard. \\nA. ISA slot \\n \\nB. VESA slot \\n \\nC. PCI slot \\n \\nThe I/O devices like FDD, HDD, Printers, mouse etc., are conn ected to the system \\nUsing their interface cards connected in the expansion slots. Expansion slots contain 8 bit or \\n16 bit or 64 bit bidirectional data bus, address lines etc. \\n8  \\n Memory: \\nThere are three types of motherboards memory as follo ws, \\n\\uf0b7 ROM – Read Only Memory \\n\\uf0b7 RAM or Main Memory – Random access memory. \\n\\uf0b7 Cache RAM \\n ROM – Read Only Memory \\nOnce data has been written onto a ROM chip, it cannot be remo ved and can only be \\nread. Unlike main memory (RAM), ROM retains its contents  even when the computer is \\nturned off. ROM is referred to as being nonvolatile, whereas  RAM is volatile. Data stored in \\nROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or n ot at all, so it is mainly used to \\nstore firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need \\nfrequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges. \\n \\n RAM  – Random Access memory \\nHigh Speed memory and it can save the program and data te mporarily. Memory chips \\nare generally packaged into a small plastic or ceramic dual inline packages (DIP). Then these \\nare assembled into a memory module. The different mem ory modules are SIMM, DIMM and \\nRIMM. \\n \\n Cache RAM  \\nThis is a small fast memory lying between the CPU and RAM. During execution, the \\nneeded data blocks are loaded form RAM to cache. From cac he it is transferred to CPU. \\n \\n SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supply) \\nSMPS stands for switch-mode power supply. SMPS is a power supply that uses a \\nswitching regulator to control and stabilize the output volt age by switchi ng the load current \\non and off. These power supplies offer a greater power conve rsion and reduce the overall \\npower loss. \\nAdvantages of switched-mode power supplies \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Higher efficiency of 68% to 90% \\n\\uf0b7 Regulated and reliable outputs regardless of variations in input supply voltage \\n\\uf0b7 Small size and lighter \\n\\uf0b7 Flexible technology \\n\\uf0b7 High power density \\n \\nDisadvantages \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Generates EMI \\n\\uf0b7 Complex circuit design \\n\\uf0b7 Expensive compared to linear supplies \\n \\n Drives \\nA drive is a mechanical device that rotates very fast an d had one or more heads to \\nread and write data on to recording medium permanently. Ther e are different types of drives \\nfor different types of recording medium. They are \\n\\uf0b7 Floppy drives to access floppy disk. \\n\\uf0b7 Optical drives to access optical disks such as CD, DVD  etc.., \\n9  \\n \\uf0b7 Hard disk drives to access hard disks. \\nDrives can be either within the computer system or external to the computer system. \\n \\n Front Panel and rear Panel connectors \\nThe following are the front panel connectors, \\n\\uf0b7 Audio connector - To connect speaker. \\n\\uf0b7 Mic Connector - To connect microphone \\n\\uf0b7 USB connector - To connect USB devices. \\nThe following are the rear panel connectors \\n\\uf0b7 Keyboard connector - To connect keyboard. \\n\\uf0b7 Serial port connector - To connect serial devices like mouse, modem. \\n\\uf0b7 Parallel port connector- To connect parallel devices like printers, plotters and exter nal \\nStorage devices. \\n\\uf0b7 VGA  connector - To connect monitor \\n\\uf0b7 RJ-45 connector - To connect LAN cable. \\nD1.2 Processors: \\n \\n Architecture and Block diagram of Multicore Processor \\n \\n \\n10  \\n A processor has more than one core to execute all the n ecessary functions of a \\ncomputer, it’s processor is known to be a multi core architecture. In other words, a chip with \\nmore than one CPU’s(Central  Processing Unit) \\n \\nMultiprocessor memory types. \\nExamples: 1. Editing a photo while recording a TV show through a digital video recorder \\n2. Downloading software while running an anti-virus program \\n \\n• Shared memory: \\nIn this model, there is one (large) common shared memory  for all processors. \\n \\n• Distributed memory: \\n\\uf0b7 In this model, each processor has its own (small) local me mory, and its content is \\nnot replicated anywhere else. \\n\\uf0b7 Multicore processor executes a collection of machine instructions. \\n\\uf0b7 ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) to perform mathematical operatio ns like addition, \\nsubtraction, division, multiplication, shifting etc. \\n\\uf0b7 It moves data from one memory location to another. \\n\\uf0b7 It makes decision and jump to a new set of instructions based on that decision. \\n\\uf0b7 It supports 32 or 64 bit processing. \\n\\uf0b7 Each core has interfaced through System bus and Memory controller. \\n\\uf0b7 It has more than one core with three levels. \\n \\n FEATURES OF NEW PROCESSORS \\nFeatures of new processors are, \\na) Hyper threading \\nb) Turbo boost technology \\nc) Multicore Technology \\n \\na) HYPER THREADING \\nIt is a technique which enables the processor to execute seri es of instruction allow at \\nthe same time. It is used to improve parallelization of computations performed on PC \\nmicroprocessor. This technique is enables single CPU to act li ke multiple CPU’s. it also  \\nenables different parts of the CPU to work on different tasks concurrently. \\n \\nb) TURBO BOOST TECHNOLOGY \\nIntel Turbo Boost is a technology implemented by Intel in certain versions of its \\nprocessors that enables the processor to run above its bas e operating frequency via dynamic \\ncontrol of the processor\\'s clock rate. The increased clock rate is limited by the \\nprocessor\\'s power, current and thermal limits, as well as the number of cores currently in use \\nand the maximum frequency of the active cores. Processo r generations supporting this feature \\nare based on the Nehalem (Turbo Boost 1.0), Sandy Bridge (Tur bo Boost 2.0) \\n \\nC) MULTICORE TECHNOLOGY \\nA multi-core processor is a single computing component wit h two or more \\nindependent actual processing units (called \"cores\"), which ar e units that read and \\nexecute program instructions. The instructions are ordinar y CPU instructions such as add, \\nmove data, and branch, but the multiple cores can run mu ltiple instructions at the same time, \\nincreasing overall speed for programs amenable to parallel  computing. \\n11  \\n  CHIPSET \\nChipset is a group of Integrated Circuits that are desig ned to work together to serve a \\nsingle function and are usually marketed as a single product.  It refers to a set of specialized \\nchips on the motherboard or an expansion card. It refers to a pair of chips on the motherboard \\n– Northbridge and Southbridge. A chipset controls communica tion between processor and \\nexternal devices, thus plays an important role in determining system performance. \\n \\n BUS STANDARDS \\nA collection   of   wires   through   which data is   tra nsmitted   from   one   part   of \\na computer to another. All buses consist of two parts : an addr ess bus and a data bus. The data \\nbus transfers actual data whereas the address bus transfer s information about where the data \\nshould go. The fastest bus is within CPU chip. This connects  the processor and its primary \\ncache. The next level is system bus or local bus. Thi s connects processor with main memory \\nand Level 2 cache. The system bus is 64 bits wide and its s peed is 100MHz. The next level is \\nI/O bus.

The featur es are, \\n\\uf0b7 AGP introduces a dedicated point- to-point channel so that the graphics controller can \\ndirectly access main memory. \\n\\uf0b7 The AGP channel is 32 bits wide and runs at 66 MHz.

In addition, AGP allows 3-D textures to be stored in mai n memory rather than \\nvideo memory. \\n\\uf0b7 Throughput: Various levels of throughput are offered: 1X is 266 MBps,  2X is 533 \\nMBps and 4X provides 1.07 GBps. \\n\\uf0b7 Pipelining: Enables the graphics card to send several instruction s together instead of \\nsending one at a time. \\nDifference between AGP and PCI \\n \\n \\n \\n Overview and features of PCMCIA bus \\nThe PCMCIA refers Personal Computer Memory Card Intern ational Association. It is \\nan   industry   group   organized   in   1989   to   promote   sta ndards   for   a   credit   card- \\nsize memory or I/O device that would fit into a personal co mputer, usually a notebook or \\nlaptop computer. There are three types of PC cards, \\n\\uf0b7 Type I PC Cards are typically used for memory devices such  as RAM, Flash, \\nOTP, and SRAM cards \\n\\uf0b7 Type II PC Cards are typically used for I/O devices such as da ta/fax modems, \\nLANs, and mass storage devices. \\n\\uf0b7 Type III PC Cards are used for devices whose components are  thicker, such as \\nrotating mass storage devices. These Extended cards allow th e addition of \\ncomponents that must remain outside the system for proper operation, such as \\nantennas for wireless applications. \\n14  \\n Block diagram of PCMICA \\n \\n \\n \\nThe features are, \\nCard Information Structure: \\nThe CIS describes the characteristics and capabilities o f the card so the host system \\ncan automatically configure it. CIS is defined in the Metaforma t Specification. \\nCard Bus: \\nCard Bus allows PC Cards and hosts to use 32-bit bus mastering and to operate at \\nspeeds up to 33MHz. \\n \\nDMA: \\nThe Standard allows cards to utilize Direct Memory Access technology directly in the \\nhardware when matched with a corresponding host syste m. \\neXecute In Place (XIP): \\nAllows operating system and application software to run directl y from the PC Card, \\neliminating the need for large amounts of system RAM. \\nLow Voltage Operation: \\nThe Standard enables 3.3 and 5-volt operation. A physical keyi ng mechanism for 3.3- \\nvolt cards protects them from being damaged in a 5-volt sl ot. \\nMultiple Function PC Cards: \\nThe Standard enables truly standardized multiple function PC-Cards. \\nPlug and Play: \\nPC Cards can be inserted or removed while the system is o n because power and \\nground contact pins are the longest contacts, ensuring that  disconnect signals disengage first, \\npreserving data integrity. \\nPower Management: \\nThe Standard provides a means to interface to APM (Advanced Power Management) \\nthrough the Card Services Specification. \\nZoomed Video (ZV): \\nZoomed Video is a connection between a PC Card and host s ystem that allows the \\ncard to write video data directly to the VGA controller. The  data is transferred with no \\nbuffering requirements because it is transferred over the ZV bus and not the system bus . \\n15  \\n  Primary Memory \\n Introduction \\nPrimary memory is also known as primary storage or main memory. It is \\ncomputer memory that is accessed directly by the CPU. This is used to store currently \\nrunning programs and data temporarily. These are stored as blocks. The two important \\noperations in a memory are storing and retrieving. Retrievi ng data from a large block takes \\nlong time than from a small block. So time of execution will increase. \\nTo avoid this problem cache memory is used to speed up the memory retrieval \\nprocess. The CPU comes with relatively small amount cache compared with main memory. It \\nis also called as Static RAM(SRAM). \\n \\n Cache Memory \\ncache memory or memory cache is a fast and relatively small memory, not visible \\nto the software, that is completely handled by the hardware , that stores the most recently used \\n(MRU ) main memory (MM) (or working memory) data. The function  of the cache memory is \\nto speed up the MM data access (performance increasing) and most important, in \\nmultiprocessor systems with shared memory, to reduce the  system bus and MM traffic that is \\none of the major bottleneck of these systems. \\nCache memory makes   use   of   the   fast   technology  SRAM (static   random- \\naccess memory cells ), against a slower MM DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), \\nconnected directly to the processor(s ). \\n \\n \\n \\nCache memory is fast and expensive. Traditionally, it is categorized as \"levels\" that \\ndescribe its closeness and accessibility to the microproce ssor: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Level 1 ( L1) cache is extremely fast but relatively small, and is usually embedded in the \\nprocessor chip (CPU). \\n16  \\n \\uf0b7 Level 2 (L2) cache is often more capacious than L1; it may be located on t he CPU or on a \\nseparate chip or coprocessor with a high-speed alternative  system bus interconnecting the \\ncache to the CPU, so as not to be slowed by traffic on the ma in system bus. \\n\\uf0b7 Level 3 (L3) cache is typically specialized memory that works to improve the \\nperformance of L1 and L2. It can be significantly slower than L1 or L2, but is usually \\ndouble the speed of RAM. In the case of multicore process ors, each core may have its own \\ndedicated L1 and L2 cache, but share a common L3 cache. When an instruction is \\nreferenced in the L3 cache, it is typically elevated to a higher tier cache. \\n Main memory \\n \\nThe main memory of the computer is also known as RAM , standing for Random \\nAccess Memory. It is constructed from integrated circui ts and needs to have electrical power \\nin order to maintain its information. When power is lost,  the information is lost too. It can be \\ndirectly accessed by the CPU. \\nThe access time to read or write any particular byte are independent of whereabouts in \\nthe memory that byte is, and currently is approximately 50 nanoseconds (a thousand \\nmillionth of a second). This is broadly comparable with th e speed at which the CPU will need \\nto access data. Main memory is expensive compared to extern al memory so it has limited \\ncapacity. Data transfer between CPU and memory takes place in a clock cycle called bus \\ncycle. The diagram gives the structure of memory. \\n \\n \\nThe different types of memories are, \\n\\uf0b7 DDR2 \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 DDR3,DDR4\\n17  \\n  DDR2  \\nDDR  (Double Data Rate) memory is the next generation SDRAM. DDR  is \\nsynchronous with the system clock. The big difference bet ween DDR  and SDRAM \\nmemory is that DDR reads data on both the rising and falli ng edges of the clock signal. \\nSDRAM only carries information on the rising edge of a si gnal. Basically this allows the \\nDDR  module to transfer data twice as fast as SDRAM. The important features are, \\n\\uf0b7 It transfers data in raising and falling edge of a processor clock pulse. So speed of \\nmemory access increase. \\n\\uf0b7 It operates 1.8 v. It leads to lower operating temperature. \\n\\uf0b7 Operation speed from 400MHZ to 1066 MHZ. \\n\\uf0b7 Peak data transfer rate is 3200 / 4266 / 5333 / 6400 / 8533 Mbps. \\n\\uf0b7 It consumes 217 MW power. \\n\\uf0b7 Size of DDR2 varies from 256 MB to 4 GB. \\n \\n DDR3:  \\nShort for double data rate three , DDR3 is a type of dynamic random-access memory \\n(DRAM) released in June of 2007 as the successor to DDR2. DDR3 c hips have bus clock \\nspeed of 400 MHz up to 1066 MHz, range in size from 1 to 24 GB, and co nsume nearly 30% \\nless power than their predecessors. DDR3 RAM sticks for a desktop computer have 240 pins. \\nFor a laptop computer, DDR3 RAM sticks have 204 pins. The impor tant key features are, \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It transfers data in raising and falling edge of a processor clock pulse. So speed of \\nmemory access increase. \\n\\uf0b7 Operating voltage is 1.5V. Higher performance at low power. \\nDDR4:  \\n\\uf0b7 Higher bandwidth performance, effectively up to 1600 to 4400MHz \\n\\uf0b7 Size varies from 16GB to 64GB. \\n Direct RDRAM  \\n18  \\n RDRAM (Rambus DRAM) is a type of computer device active memo ry developed \\nand licensed by Rambus Inc. RDRAM competed with synchronous d ynamic RAM (SDRAM) \\nduring the late 1990s and early 2000s. \\n \\nA Direct Rambus channel includes a controller and one or  more Direct RDRAMs \\nconnected together via a common bus which can also conne ct to devices such as micro- \\nprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), graphics proc essors and ASICs. The controller is \\nlocated at one end, and the RDRAMS are distributed along the bus, which is parallel \\nterminated at the far end. The two-byte wide channel uses a  small number of very high speed \\nsignals to carry all address, data and control information a t up to 800MHz. \\nImportant key features are, \\n\\uf0b7 Bus speed of 133MHZ and above \\n\\uf0b7 It uses pipeline memory architecture. \\n\\uf0b7 Data transfer rate is 1.6 Gbps, 3.2 Gbps and 6.4Gbps. \\n\\uf0b7 Operating speed is 100MHZ to 1000MHZ. \\n\\uf0b7 Cost is very high. \\n\\uf0b7 One or more DRDRAM’s  can be connected through a common bus with a \\nmemory controller. \\n Secondary storage: \\nHARD DISK \\nIntroduction \\nThe hard drive of a computer is a device that stores all th e software installed on a \\ncomputer, as well as all the data files created and used by t his software. The hard disk drive \\nwas invented by an IBM in 1954 with 5MB capacity. Nowadays, HDD wi th 3.5inch or 5.25 \\ninch platters in different capacities such as 10GB, 20GB, 40GB,  80GB etc. \\n Construction: \\nHard disks are rigid platters, composed of a substrate and a magnetic medium. The \\nsubstrate platter’s base material must be non -magnetic and capable of being machined to a \\nsmooth finish. It is made either of aluminum alloy or a mixture of glass and ceramic. It \\nallows data storage, both sides of each platter are coate d with a magnetic medium – formerly \\nmagnetic oxide, but now, almost exclusively, a layer of met al called a thin-film medium. This \\nstores data in magnetic patterns, with each platter capabl e of storing a billion or so bits per \\nsquare inch (bpsi) of platter surface. \\n \\n \\n19  \\n Head Actuator: \\nThe actuator is the device used to position the head arms t o different tracks on the \\nsurface of the platter (actually, to different cylinders, s ince all head arms are moved as a \\nsynchronous unit, so each arm moves to the same track number of its respective surface). \\nThe actuator is a very important part of the hard disk, beca use changing from track to \\ntrack is the only operation on the hard disk that require s active movement: changing heads is \\nan electronic function, and changing sectors involves wait ing for the right sector number to \\nspin around and come under the head (passive movement). Ch anging tracks means the heads \\nmust be shifted so making sure this movement can be done quic kly and accurately is of \\nparamount importance. \\n \\nSpindle motor \\nThe spindle motor is used to rotate the shaft or spindle w here the platters or discs are \\nplaced. This motor rotates at a speed of 3600 rpm. All the platter s move in the same direction. \\nThe speed of the motor is controlled by an electronics m onitor. \\n \\nLogic Boards \\nThese are electronic boards which are used to control the drives spindle and head \\nactuator systems. \\n \\nOrganization of hard disk \\n \\nEach disk has two recording surface. The top portion of th e disk and bottom portion \\ndisk are not used. It acts as a protection plate. Each recording surface is divided into tracks. A \\nset of corresponding tracks in all sides of disks is ca lled a cylinder. A given file or record is \\nstored on one cylinder. Each track is further divided into s ectors. A sector is the smallest \\naddressable part of the disk and each sector class has 512 byt e of data. The presence of \\nmagnetized spot represents 1 bit and its absence represe nt 0 bit. The storage capacity of a \\ndisk is calculated by the formula of \\nStorage capacity = Number of cylinders X Tracks per cylinders X Sectors per track X Byes \\nper Sector. \\n \\n Working principle \\nThe working of hard disk depends on the file allocation table entry (FTA) \\nis a table present in the beginning of the partition containing details about the data stored an d \\nfree area location in hard disk. The figure given below  showed the structure of a FTA. \\n20  \\n  \\n \\n \\nThe following are the two operations on the hard disk \\ni. Reading \\nii. Writing \\n \\n(i) Reading \\nThe computer follows the following steps to read a data from the hard \\ndisk. \\n\\uf0b7 When a request is given by the CUP to read data, the O/S reads the FTA from \\nhard disk and compares the requested file with FTA. \\n\\uf0b7 If it is present O/S reads the track and sector details of the fil e. \\n\\uf0b7 Then O/S sends request to the hard disk control for reading t he specified file \\nfrom the hard disk. \\n\\uf0b7 Disk controller drives the spending and head actuator and l ocate the \\ncorresponding sectors under the read/write heads. \\n\\uf0b7 The heads read the magnetic information from the sector s and convert it into \\ndigital and send it to CUP. \\n \\n(ii) Writing \\nThe computer follows the following steps to write a data o nto the hard disk \\n\\uf0b7 When a write request is given from the cup , the O/S reads the FTA from hard \\ndisk and search for free area. \\n\\uf0b7 If it is present, it informs the disk controller. \\n\\uf0b7 The disk controller drives the spindle and head actuato r and locate the selected \\nfree sectors (area) under the read/write heads \\n\\uf0b7 Then the O/S sends write signals to the disk controller. \\n\\uf0b7 The disk controller receives the digital data from CUP and convert it into \\nanalog signals. \\n\\uf0b7 According to the analog signals, the head magnetizes t he sectors. \\nTo improve the operation a cache buffer is added to the har d disk drive. The size of \\nthe cache buffer is between 256KB and 8MB. \\n \\n Hard disk specification \\nThe important specifications are \\n\\uf0b7 IDE \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Ultra ATA \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Serial ATA \\uf020\\n21  \\n (i) IDE \\nIDE stands for integrate drive electronics. It was develope d in the year \\n1986 by western digital and comaq. The name IDE is because disk drive itself \\ncontains the disk controller function. The important feat ures are \\ni. IDE drives can be connected directly to the system bus \\nii. IDE drives are cost effective \\niii. IDE drives can be connected to all the types of systems.  \\niv. IDE design supports two internal hard disk \\n(ii) Ultra ATA \\nThis was introduced in the year 1997. it uses AT attachment program \\nparallel interface standard. So it can provide common int erface for CDROM \\ndrive, tape backup drivers and removable drives. The following are important \\nultra ATA’s  These interface can control a maximum of 2 devices. \\na. Ultra ATA-4 \\nb. Ultra ATA-5 \\nc. Ultra ATA-6 \\n \\n IDE \\n \\nShort for Integrated Drive Electronics or IBM Disc Elec tronics. It meaning the drive can \\nconnect directly to the motherboard or controller. Th e older standard that SATA replaced. It \\nwas developed in the year 1986 by western digital and company. The importan t features are, \\n \\nIDE drives are high cost. \\n\\uf0b7 IDE design supports to internal hard disk \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 IDE drives can be connected to all the types of systems. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 IDE drives cab be connected directly to the system bus. \\uf020\\n Ultra ATA \\nIn the second half of 1997 EIDE’s 16.6 MB/s limit was doubled to 33 M B/s by the  \\nnew Ultra ATA. As well as increasing the data transfer rat e, Ultra ATA also improved data \\nintegrity by using a data transfer error detection code call ed Cyclical Redundancy Check \\n(CRC). Important ultra ATA’s are,  \\n\\uf0b7 Ultra ATA-4 \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Ultra ATA – 5\\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Ultra ATA – 6\\uf020\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Ultra ATA 4 \\nThe standard ATA-4 interface began to support Ultra DMA data t ransfer mode, ATA-4 \\nwas also called Ultra DMA 33 or ATA33. It was introduced in 1997.  Features are \\n\\uf0b7 Double Data Rate was first introduced on ATA interface, enforcing interface to \\nperform twice data transfer, one during ascending period and another during \\ndescending period, within one clock period, which abruptly increas ed the data transfer \\nrate from 16MB/s to 33MB/8. \\uf020\\n22  \\n \\uf0b7 Ultra DMA 33 also introduced another new technology, CRC, whi ch sends cyclic \\nredundancy code and checks the code when the opposite party is receiving. Only \\nwhen all checks are correct will the data be received and pr ocessed, casting strong \\nguarantee to the safety of high-speed data transfer. \\uf020\\n Ultra ATA – 5 \\nIt was introduced in 1999. Features are \\n\\uf0b7 ATA-5, also called as \"Ultra DMA 66\" or \"ATA66\", is built on the base of Ultra \\nDMA 33 hard disk interface and adopts UDMA technology. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Ultra DMA 66 has the receiving/sending rate reached 66.6 MB/s, which is two times \\nas fast as that of U-DMA/33. As working frequency increases, EMI still arises on \\nATA interface. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Interface begins to use 80-cable with 40-pin. 40-pin. \\uf020\\n \\n\\uf0b7 It reduce cost and all cables newly increased on 80-cable are earth cables \\ncorresponding with original data lines which reduces electr omagnetic interference \\nbetween neighboring signal wires. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Signal Voltage is 5v. \\uf020\\n \\n Ultra ATA-6 \\nIt was introduced in 2000. Features are \\n\\uf0b7 ATA100 interface and data line are the same with ATA66 us ing 40-pin 80-core data \\ntransfer cable and with complete downward compatibility. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 It supports cyclic Redundancy check (CRC). \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 All devices supporting ATA33 and ATA66 can be used on ATA100 interface. \\nATA100 specification can easily deal with all current thorny problems of ATA33 and \\nATA66. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 It allows hard disk external rate to reach 100MB/s, improving har d disk data integrity \\nand data transfer rate and considerably improving disk subsystem  performance of \\ndesktop system. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 The signal voltage is 3.3v \\uf020\\n Serial ATA \\nIt was introduced in 1999 by serial data working group. Serial ATA (SATA, \\nabbreviated from Serial AT Attachment) is a computer bus in terface that connects host bus \\nadapters to mass storage devices such   as hard disk drives, optical   drives and solid- \\nstate drives. Important features are, \\n\\uf0b7 It requires low voltage of 500 mv peak to peak. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 It can have flexible connector cable up to one meter. So it is easy to route inside the \\nPC’s  chassis. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 The number of pins in the connector is reduced below 40. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 It has a lot of options for checking and correction. \\uf020\\n23  \\n \\uf0b7 It’s data transfer rate is 150MB/s to 600MB/s. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Data transmission is sure. \\uf020\\n HDD Partition \\nDisk partitioning or disk slicing is the technique for creating o ne or more regions on a \\nhard disk or other secondary storage, so that an operating sys tem can manage information in \\neach region separately. Each partition then appears in the operating system as a distinct \\n\"logical\" disk that uses part of the actual disk. \\n \\nAdvantages  \\n\\uf0b7 Hard drive to manage data in category wise. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Portioning a hard drive is advantageous to the virus prevention and data security. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Use the hard disk efficiently. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Improving the efficiency of the system. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Assign different permissions for different users. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Helpful to install multiple operating systems. \\uf020\\n \\n Formatting \\nDisk formatting is the configuring process of a data storage m edia such as a hard disk \\ndrive, floppy disk or flash drive for initial usage. Any exi sting files on the drive would be \\nerased with disk formatting. Disk formatting is usually done before initial installation or \\nbefore installation of a new operating system. Disk formatt ing is also done if there is a \\nrequirement for additional storage in the computer. There are two types of disk formatting, \\n\\uf0b7 Low-Level formatting \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 High – Level formatting \\uf020\\nLow-Level formatting \\nLow-level formatting is the process of marking out cylinders  and tracks for a blank \\nhard disk, and then dividing tracks into multiple sectors. T his process is often called the \\n“real” formatting since it creates physical format which defines  where the data is saved. If \\nusers perform low-level formatting when data have been in stalled, all existing files will be \\nerased, and it is almost impossible to recover them. \\n \\nHigh - Level formatting \\nAfter a low-level formatting has been completed, users  need to make high-level \\nformatting which makes it possible to save data and should be  done on a partition. It is the \\nprocess of writing a file system, cluster size, partition label, and so on for a newly created \\npartition or volume. This process does no harm to hard di sk in general situations, so we \\nsuggest taking such a format to fix a logically damaged parti tion or device, for example, \\nWindows asks to format a SD card. \\n \\n Removable Storage \\nRemovable media is any type of storage device that can be re moved from a computer \\nwhile the system is running. Examples of removable media inc lude CDs, DVDs and Blu-Ray \\ndisks, as well as diskettes and USB drives. Removable media makes it easy for a user to \\nmove data from one computer to another. \\n24  \\n  CD-R \\nThe        first        recordable        specificatio n        (CD-WO)        was        published \\nin 1989 by Philips and Sony in the Orange Book. CD-R Stands for \"Compact Disc \\nRecordable.\" CD-R discs are blank CDs that can record data  written by a CD burner. The \\ndata burned onto a CD-R disc is permanent, meaning it cannot be altered or erased like the \\ndata on a hard drive. \\nTypically, once a CD has been burned, it will not be able to record any more data. Some CD \\nburning programs can record data as \"sessions,\" allowing a di sc to be written to multiple \\ntimes until it is full. Each session creates a new part ition on the disc, meaning a computer will \\nread a disc with multiple sessions as multiple discs. CD-RWs, on the other hand, can be \\nerased and completely re-recorded. Like CDs, the data on CD-RWs cannot be altered, \\nmeaning the disc has to be completely erased each time you want to add new data. The CD \\nhas spiral track of width 0.6 micron and pitch 1.6 microns  over a polycarbonate disc called \\npregroove. \\n \\n \\nThe different layers of CR-R, \\nProtective layer - This is a lacquer coating layer. It is used to protect the disk from \\nscratch and dust. \\nReflective layer - This is thin layer of silvery alloy or 24 carat gold. This i s used to give \\nEffective reflection during reading. \\nRecording Layer - This layer is coated with recording dye such as Cyanine, \\nPhthalocyanine dye and Azo dye. \\nPregroove - It is made during construction of CD. The width of the spiral track is \\n0.6 micron and its pitch size is 1.6 micron. \\n \\n CD-RW \\nCD-RW Stands for \"Compact Disc Re-Writable.\" A CD-RW is a blank CD that can \\nbe written to by a CD burner. Unlike a CD-R (CD-Recordable), a CD-RW can be written to \\nmultiple times. The data burned on a CD-RW cannot be cha nged, but it can be erased. \\nTherefore, you have to completely erase a CD-RW every time you want to change the files or \\nadd new data. While it may be somewhat inconvenient, this capability makes CD-RWs a \\ngood choice for making frequent backups. However, because CD-R Ws can be erased, they \\ndon\\'t store data reliably for as long as CD-Rs do. Therefor e, you should use regular CD- Rs \\nfor long-term backups. \\n \\nThe technology behind CD-RW is optical phase-change, whic h in its own right is \\nnothing radical. However, the technology used in CD-Rewrit able does not incorporate any \\nmagnetic field like the phase-change technology. A CD- RW disc’s phase -change medium \\nconsists of a polycarbonate substrate, molded with a spiral groove for servo guidance. The \\n25  \\n recording layer is sandwiched between dielectric layers t hat draw excess heat from the phase- \\nchange layer during the writing process. In place of the C D-R disc’s dye -based recording \\nlayer, CD-RW commonly uses a crystalline compound made up of a mix of silver, indium, \\nantimony and tellurium. This rather exotic mix has a very special property: when it’s heated \\nto one temperature and cooled it becomes crystalline, but if it’s heated to a higher \\ntemperature, when it cools down again it becomes amorphous. The crystalline areas allow the \\nmetalised layer to reflect the laser better while the n on-crystalline portion absorbs the laser \\nbeam, so it is not reflected. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe different layers are, \\n \\nProtective layer - This is a lacquer coating layer. This is used to protect the disk from \\nscratch and dust. \\nReflective layer  - This is thin layer of silvery alloy or 24 carat gold. This is used to \\ngive effective reflection during reading. \\nRecording Layer  - It is a layer of crystalline compound. This contains a mix of silver, \\nindium, antimony and tellurium. The property of this layer  is, \\n\\uf0b7 When it is heated to high temperature and cooled, it becomes amorphous. \\n\\uf0b7 When it is heated to a medium temperature and cooled, it b ecomes crystalline. The \\ncrystalline layer reflects more than non crystalline la yer. This layer is placed between \\ntwo dielectric materials. \\n \\nDielectric Layer - It is a layer which is used to absorb the excess heat generated during \\nwriting process. \\nPregroove - It is made during construction of CD. The width of the spiral track is \\n0.6 micron and its pitch size is 1.6 micron. \\nWriting \\n \\nDuring writing, a focused Write Power laser beam selectively  heats areas of the \\nphase-change material above the melting temperature (500-700oC), so all the atoms in this \\narea can move rapidly in the liquid state. Then, if coole d sufficiently quickly, the random \\nliquid state is frozen-in and the so-called amorphous stat e is obtained. The amorphous version \\nof the material shrinks, leaving a pit where the laser dot wa s written, resulting in a \\nrecognizable CD surface. When an Erase Power laser beam h eats the phase-change layer to \\nbelow the melting temperature but above the crystalliza tion temperature (200oC) for a \\nsufficient time (at least longer than the minimum crys tallization time), the atoms revert back \\nto an ordered state (i.e. the crystalline state). Writi ng takes place in a single pass of the \\nfocused laser beam.This is sometimes referred to as dire ct overwriting and the process can be \\nrepeated several thousand times per disc. \\n26  \\n Reading \\n \\nTo read the data in the CD, a low power laser is made to fall  on the surface of the CD. \\nThe amorphous area (pits) reflects less light and cryst alline area reflects more light with the \\nhelp of the different in reflective we can read the da ta. \\n \\nErasing \\n \\nErasing of a CD-RW disc is performed by returning the mater ial in the recording layer which \\nhas been changed to the amorphous state back to the crystalline st ate. This is done by an annealing \\nprocess, consisting of heating the layer to a temperature of about 200oC (i.e. less than the melting \\npoint) and maintaining that temperature for an extended period (in practice, this takes some 37 \\nminutes for a complete disc). The disc is then returned to its original, completely unrecorded state. \\n \\n DVD  – ROM \\n \\nDigital versatile disc-read only memory (DVD-ROM) is a read -only digital versatile disc \\n(DVD) commonly used for storing large software applications. It is similar to a compact disk-read \\nonly memory (CD-ROM) but has a larger capacity. A typical DVD-ROM can hold up to 17 GB/s of \\ndata if both sides of the disc are writable. The technology used in DVD s are, \\n \\ni. DVD-ROM has the same 5 inch diameter and 1.2 millimeter  (mm) thickness. It has three layers \\n1. Polycarbonate layer, \\n2. Thin sheet of aluminum over the polycarbonate layer. \\n3. A lacquare coating over the aluminum. This is to protect the disk form internal scratches \\nand dust. \\n \\nii. A DVD-ROM uses a shorter wavelength laser with tighter compa cted pits, the disc capacity is \\nincreased. In fact, the smallest DVD-ROM can store approxi mately 7 times more data than a \\nCD-ROM. \\n \\n \\niii. The DVD-ROM is comprised of two 0.6 millimeters (mm) acryli c layers bonded together. The \\ndouble-sided disc consists of two recordable grooved sides. With two layers, a DVD’s  laser \\nbeam only has to go through 0.06 mm to reach the recording la yer. Having a thin layer allows the \\nlens to focus the beam to a smaller spot size, which in turn writes smaller pits for more data. \\n \\n \\niv. The data is encoded in the form of spiral pits that are mere ly nanometers apart. The spiral path \\nbegins at the center of the disc and coils numerous times until i t reaches the outer edge. With a \\ndouble-layered disc the path continues to the second layer. A d ouble-sided disc needs to be \\nmanually turned over and the path resumes in the center. \\n \\n \\nv. DVD has effective error correction codes. So DVDs are a best medium to store data. \\n27  \\n  \\n \\nFig: Single side dual layer \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n DVD  – RW \\n \\nDVD-RW Stands for \"Digital Versatile Disk Rewritable.\" A DVD-RW is like a DVD-R but \\ncan be erased and written to again. Like CD-RWs, DVD-RWs must  be erased in order for new data to \\nbe added. DVD-RWs can hold 4.7GB of data and do not come in do uble-layered or double-sided \\nversions like DVD-Rs do. Because of their large capacity and a bility to be used multiple times, DVD- \\nRW discs are a great solution for frequent backups. To record data onto a DVD- RW disc, you\\'ll need \\na DVD burner that supports the DVD-RW format. \\n28  \\n  \\n \\n \\nWriting \\nDuring writing, laser beam of wave length 650 µm is used to heat selected spots 500o- \\n700oC. So the sports change to liquid state. Then the spots ar e allowed to cool. After cooling \\nthe spots become amorphous state. \\nReading \\nTo read the data in the DVD, a low power laser is made to fa ll on the surface of the \\nDVD. The amorphous area reflects less light and crystalli ne area reflects more light with the \\nhelp of the difference in reflectivity we can read the data. \\nErasing \\nTo erase the data in the DVD, a medium power laser of tem perature 200oC is made to \\nfall on the recording layer. This melts the amorphous area and  reverts back to crystalline \\nstate. \\n \\n \\n Construction and Working of DVD Reader / Writer \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure shows that the block diagram of DVD RW drive \\n29  \\n Focus servo: \\nFocus servo is used to focus the laser beam in the middle of the pit to read the \\nrecorded data on the track and to focus the laser on the t rack to write the data.

It is used to give text, numbers and controls as input to \\ncomputer. The keyboard resembles the structure of ordinary typewriter keyboard with some \\nadditional keys. \\n Keyboard signals \\n \\n \\nThe keyboard is connected to the system board through a flexi ble standard DIN \\nconnecto r. There are two types of DIN connectors. They are \\n(i) 5 PIN DIN connector \\n(ii) 6 PIN DIN connector \\nThe signals are \\nPin 1 - keyboard clock Pin 1 – keyboard data \\nPin 2 - keyboard data Pin 2 – Not used \\nPin 3 - Not used Pin 4 – Ground \\nPin 4 - Ground Pin 4 – Vcc(+5V) \\nPin 5 - Vcc(+5V) Pin 5 – keyboard clock \\nPin 6 – not used \\nKeyboard clock - This provides the clock pulse to the keyboard from the system. \\nKeyboard data - This is used to send the scan codes from t he keyboard to \\nthe computer serially. \\nGround - This is the common ground for all the keyboard circuits. \\nVcc(+5V) - This will provide the required supply for the operation  of keyboard \\nThe keyboard clock line and keyboard data line are bidirectio nal. \\n \\nTypes of keyboard \\nThere are two types of keyboard depending on the type of the key switches. They are \\n(i) Simple or membrane keyboard \\n(ii) Mechanical keyboard \\n2.1.2 Simple or membrane keyboard \\nThe simple keyboard consists of a plastic actuator. Top side of the actuator consists of \\na push button and the bottom side rests on a rubber boot coat ed with conductive silver – \\ncarbon compound. \\nWhen the user presses the keyboard push button, the plastic actuator compresses the \\nrubber boot and makes a contact between the row and column c ircuit in the keyboard matrix. \\nWhen the push button key is released, the compressed rubber bo ot releases and breaks the \\ncontact. \\n33  \\n  Mechanical keyboard \\nThe figure given below shows the structure of a mechanical key board switch. \\n \\n \\nAs shown in the above figure, a plastic actuator separates t wo tempered bronze contacts. Top \\nside of the actuator consists of a push and the bottom side rests  on a spring. \\nWhen the user presses the keyboard push button, the actuator  slides down and \\ncompress the spring. This action makes the gold contacts to close the row and column circuit \\nin the keyboard matrix. When the push button key is releas ed the spring releases the actuator \\nand breaks the contact. \\n \\n Trouble shooting the keyboard \\n \\nTypical problem and trouble shooting \\n \\nProblem - During initialization an error message indicating that the keyboard lock is on . \\nSolution \\n\\uf076 Make sure that the keyboard lock is unlocked. If not unlock it. \\n\\uf076 If the switch is in unlocked position and if the system deflects unlocked check the \\nworking of the switch. \\n\\uf076 If the switch is working, the problem may be with the mo therboard. \\nProblem – The keyboard is completely dead – no keys appear to function. \\nSolution \\n\\uf076 Try with a alternate keyboard. If it works, the problem is probably on the keyboard \\ninterface chip. It is better to replace the keyboard rather than the chip. \\n\\uf076 If the alternate keyboard fails, using multimeter check f or +5V supply at the \\nkeyboard connector. If this is missing, the female keyboard connector may be broken. \\n\\uf076 Check the keyboard connector pico – fuse. \\n\\uf076 If the problem still exists replace the mother board. \\nProblem - KBC error or a similar message displayed during system  bootup. \\nSolution \\n\\uf076 This is due to either data signals are missing or keyboard clock missing. It is better to \\nreplace the motherboard. \\n34  \\n  Wireless keyboard \\n \\nWireless keyboard is a keyboard connected to the computer wi thout wires. But it is \\nconnected to the computer through infrared(IR) or Bluetooth or radio frequency connections. \\nThe signals sent from the keyboard is received by the re ceipt. The receiver is either in or \\nplugged into the USB port. Since the keyboard has no connec tion with the computer it must \\nbe powered has no connection with the computer it must be  powered by either battery or AC \\npower. \\nSignals \\nThe signals in the wireless keyboard are \\n(i) Ratio frequency of infrared or Bluetooth signal sent from the keyboard to the \\nreceiver. \\n(ii) The receiver in the USB port receivers the signal and sends it to the CPU. The CPU \\nconverts the scan code into ASCII form. \\nOperation \\nThe PC keyboard has a micro controller chip called keyboar d controller. This has a \\nbuilt in ROM program that senses the pressed key. The key  switches are connected in a \\nmatrix of rows and columns to the micro controller chip. Th e figure given below shows the \\nblock diagram of keyboard operation. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen a key is pressed on the keyboard, it sends a control  signal to the keyboard \\ncontroller. The keyboard controller generates a code ca lled scan code corresponding to the \\nsignal received. This code is placed in the keyboard buffe r and it sends interrupt signal to the \\nCPU through a system software using wireless transmitte r. \\nThe CPU stops its current execution and reads the scan code  from the keyboard \\nbuffer. Then it converts the scan code into its ASCI I form. \\n \\n Mouse \\n35  \\n Mouse is an input device. This is used to control the pointer movement on the screen \\nby moving it over a flat surface. It contains two or thre e buttons on the top. \\n \\nWhen the user presses one of the buttons, the mouse eit her marks a location on the \\nscreen or makes selections from data on the screen. This can also be used in combination \\nwith a keyboard. The operations on a mouse can be classi fied into three types. They are \\n(i) Click \\n(ii) Double click \\n(iii) Drag \\n \\n \\n TYPES \\nThe following are the different types of mouse. \\n(i) Serial mouse \\n(ii) PS/2 mouse \\n(iii) Optical mouse \\n(iv) Wireless mouse \\n \\n CONNECTORS \\nA mouse connector is a dedicated socket or interface in the computer for connecting a \\nmouse. A mouse can be connected to the system using any one interface. \\n(i) Through a D- type DIN connector in the serial port interface. \\n(ii) Through a 6 pin PS/2 DIN socket interface. \\n(iii) Through USB port. \\n(iv) Through wireless methods. \\n \\nDepending on the structure of the connector present in the mouse cable end, \\nit is connected to any one of the above interfaces. \\n \\n OPTICAL MOUSE OPERATION \\n \\nOptical mouse is made up of plastic with one or more switches the top and a light \\nemitting diode (LED) on its lower surface. The figure given below shows the bloc k diagram. \\n \\nWhen the mouse is moved, the light from the LED  is reflected by the surface. The \\nreflected eight is made to fall on a metal- oxide semiconductor sensor called tracking sensor. \\n \\nThe sensor sends each reflected image to a digital signal  processor (DSP) for analysis. \\nThe DSP detects the patterns in the images and finds how the  patterns moved since the \\nprevious image. \\n \\nBased on the change in patterns over a sequence of images,  the DSP determines how \\nfar the mouse has moved. Then it sends the corresponding co – ordinates to the computer. \\nThe computer moves the cursor on the screen based on the  coordinates received from the \\nmouse. \\n36  \\n OPTICAL MOUSE \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trouble shooting optical mouse \\nThe following are some important problems occurring in optical mouse and the \\nsolution for trouble shooting. \\nProblem – Mouse cursor is not moving properly. \\nSolution \\n\\uf076 Check the cable and see it is properly inserted in the port.  \\n\\uf076 Clean the optical sensor and the bottom surface with a  moist towel. \\n\\uf076 Check whether the mouse settings in the control panel are  properly selected. \\n\\uf076 Still the problem exists, replace the mouse with a new one . \\nProblem – Mouse button do not work. \\nSolution \\n\\uf076 Check whether any obstructions blocking the buttons. \\n\\uf076 Blow air using vaccum cleaner through the gap between the  buttons. \\n\\uf076 Check whether the settings in the control panel are properly  selected. \\n\\uf076 Still the problem exists, the button may be worn out because of continuous usage. \\nSo replace the mouse. \\n Printers \\n Introduction \\nPrinter is an output device. This is used to take hard copies of any computer based \\napplication. \\n Types \\nThe following are the important types of printers used with personal computers. \\n(i) Dot matrix printer \\n(ii) Ink jet printer \\n37  \\n (iii) Laser printer \\n(iv) Line printer \\n(v) Multi function printer(MFP) \\n Dot matrix printer \\nIn this printer the characters are formed with the help of dots. So this is called dot \\nmatrix printer. There are three types of dot matrix prin ters. They are \\n(a) 7- pin pointers \\n(b) 9- pin pointers \\n(c) 24- pin pointers \\n \\nOperation of 7- pin pointer \\nThe print head of the dot matrix printer consists of a column of 7 small needles. Each \\nneedle can move freely. \\nEach needle can be made to print a dot by means of a hamm er action that forces the \\nneedle to come out and press the ribbon against the paper. Standard characters are produced \\nin a 5x7 dot matrix. (7dots high and 5 dots wide). The figure giv en below shows the \\noperation of a dot matrix printer. \\nThe characters are printed column by column and not all at once, for example to print \\nthe character T, initially pin number 1 is made to contac t the ribbon. Thus first column of the \\ncharacters is got. Then the print head is moved towards ri ght and once again the pin 1 is made \\nto contact the ribbon. Thus second column of the characte r is got. Then the print head is \\nmoved to get the third column and so on. \\n \\n \\nConstruction \\n \\n \\nFront panel \\nThis consists of a minimum three status light (LED) and three soft touch switches. \\nThe lights are used to give information about the status  of the printer to the user. Switches are \\nused to give control commands. For example font selecti on. \\nDIP switches \\nThese switches are present in the interface card and are used to change the printer \\nsettings. The settings that can be changed are \\n(i) Printing of graphics and accented characters \\n(ii) Page length \\n38  \\n (iii) Slashed zeros \\n(iv) Line spacing \\n(v) Print quality \\n(vi) Auto line feed \\n(vii) Character set for different countries. \\nSensors \\nThese are used to keep the printer safe from abnormal conditions. The d ifferent \\nsensors are \\n(i) Home sensor - this is used to detect whether the head carr iage \\nis in the extreme left margin. \\n(ii) Paper sensor - this is used to signal when there is sens or no paper in \\nthe printer. \\n(iii) Temperature - this is used to detect the normal sensor timi ngs used \\nto fire the pins. \\nPrint mechanism \\nThis contains two subsystems. They are \\n(i) Carriage movement - this moves the carriage control Mec hanism \\nbidirectionally by means of a stepper motor \\n(ii) Ribbon feed - this feeds the ribbon when mechanism the pri nt \\nhead is printing. \\n \\nFeatures \\n(i) Both text and graphics can be printed. \\n(ii) Printing cost is very low \\n(iii) Multiple copies can be taken with the help of carbon pape rs. \\n(iv) By increasing the number of pins from 7 to 9 or 24 the quality of printing can be \\nincreased. \\n(v) It’s operating speed is slow. \\nTroubleshooting dot matrix printer \\nProblem – printer does not function. \\nSolution \\n\\uf076 Check the AC supply, if not proper fix it properly. Check the fuses, if necessary \\nreplace it. \\n\\uf076 If the power light is ON. Check the ON – LINE connection, cable connections and try \\nagain. \\n\\uf076 If the printer is still not working, try a self test printing. If it prints, the problem is \\nwith the cable or computer else the problem is with the printer. \\nProblem – The printer does not print during self test. \\nSolution \\n\\uf076 Check the manual for the proper selection of combination of switches for self test. \\nPower on the printer and try self test. If the printer  is not printing, the problem is with \\nthe cable connecting the print head and the motor board cont rol or with the command \\nelectronics in the printer’s  main board. Get the help of service engineer. \\n39  \\n  Ink jet printer \\n \\nOperation \\nInkjet printers are non – impact printers. The characters are formed by spraying ink \\ndroplets on the paper. This is done by pumping ink through a no zzle from an ink tank. \\nThe figure given below shows the structure of an inkjet print er. \\nThe ink jet from the tank is filtered and pumped out through a  nozzle. A crystal \\noscillating a high frequency makes the ink to split into sma ll drops. The ink drops are charged \\nby using two electrodes as shown in the figure. This charged ink drops are deflected on the \\npaper in such a way that it prints characters by using v ertical deflection plates. \\nConstruction \\nThe figure given above shows the block diagram of an inkjet printer. \\n \\n \\nInterface Connector \\nPrinters are connected to the computer through a 36 pin cent uries interface cable. The \\ndata are received from the computer and stored in the print ers buffer RAM. The buffer RAM \\ncan store one line to one page depending on the size of th e RAM. \\nControl electronics \\nThis unit contains an intelligent processor for controlling  the functions of the printer. \\nDriver Circuit \\nThis unit is used to control the print cartridge movement, paper feed mechani sm, \\nfiring mechanism and control panel. Also it sends feedback si gnals to control electronics for \\nmonitoring the speed displacements of the mechanisms. \\nPaper feed mechanism \\nThis unit is used to feed paper to the printer for printing .there  is a paper sensor to \\nsense the availability of paper. If there is no paper, it informs it to the user. \\nInk cartridge carriage movement \\nThe ink cartridge is placed on this carriage and is moved left and right by a stepper \\nmotor. \\nFiring mechanism \\nThe ink from the cartridge is drawn into the firing cham ber. In this, the ink drop is \\nheaded up to 9000C by means of a film resistor. This produces an ink bubble and is ejected \\nout of the firing mechanism. The ejected heat ink bubble is  deposition on the paper to form a \\ndot. \\n40  \\n Control panel \\nThis unit contains the following buttons and lights \\n(i) ON/OFF switch - to switch on the power \\n(ii) Load/eject switch - to load or eject paper \\n(iii) Nozzle cleaning button - to clean the cartridge nozzle or to replace \\nInkcartridge \\n(iv) LED light - this light blinks when the ink cartridge \\nbecomes empty \\n \\nFeatures \\n(i) Both color and B & W printing is possible. \\n(ii) Speed of printing is higher than dot matrix printer. \\n(iii) Noise is less than dot matrix printer. \\n(iv) Print quality is high \\n(v) Variety of fonts is available \\n(vi) Ink cartridges are portable and low cost. \\n(vii) Replacing of cartridge is easy. \\n(viii) Different paper sizes can be used. \\n \\nTroubleshooting inkjet printer \\nProblem - printer sounds like it is printing, but not prints \\nSolution \\n\\uf076 print head nozzles may be clogged. Clean the print head nozzles by using the nozzl e \\nclean facility in the printer software. \\n\\uf076 The ink cartridges may be older than six months. Clean the print head by using prin t \\nhead cleaning facility in the printer software. \\n\\uf076 If the problem still exists replace the ink cartridge. \\n \\n Laser printer \\nThe laser printer was introduced by Hewlett- Packard in 1981. These printers are high \\nspeed non- impact printers. \\n \\nOperation \\n \\nstructure of a laser printer \\n \\nThe heart of the laser printer is a small rotating drum made up of aluminium. This \\ncontains a coating that holds an electrostatic charge when exposed to light. Initially the drum \\n41  \\n is given a high negative charge of about 600V. Then a laser be am is made to scan the drum \\nwith the help of rotating polygonal mirror. The light- bea m discharges the area on the drum \\nfrom – 600V to – 100V according to the characters to be printed. \\nNow a toner is applied over the drum surface. The low negative area(char acters) on \\nthe drum attracts the toner. Then a positive charged paper  is made to move over the drum. \\nNow the characters on the drum are transferred to the pape r. By applying heat and pressure to \\nthe paper the image is made permanent. \\nConstruction \\nThe figure given below shows the block diagram of a laser printer. \\nThe important units are \\n(i) Drum cleaning blade \\nThis unit is used to clean the photosensitive drum before prin ting \\nnew images. If it is not cleaned properly ghost images will appear on the output. \\n(ii) Eraser lamp \\nThe light from this lamp is made to fall on the drum to ne utralize \\nthe residual charges. \\n \\n(iii) Primary corona \\nThis unit is used to charge the photosensitive drum to -600V .this is the first \\nstep in printing and is called conditioning. \\n \\n(iv) Laser beam unit \\nUsing this unit a laser beam is focused on the drum using a r otating polygonal \\nmirror. This light discharges there on the drum according to the characters to be printed \\nThis is the second step in printing and is called transferring the image to the drum  \\n(v) Toner unit \\nThis unit contains a developing cylinder maintained -600V. The toner from the \\ntoner tray is spread over this. When the cylinder comes in contact with the \\naluminium photosensitive drum, the toner particles are attracted on the image. This is \\nthe third stage in printing and is called deposition of toner.  \\n(vi) Transfer corona \\nThis unit is used to charge the paper to +600V. when the rotating alu minium drum \\ncomes in contact with the charged paper, the toner image will trans fer on to the paper. This is \\nthe fourth stage in printing and is called image transfer.  \\n(vii) Fusing rollers \\nThese rollers are maintained at 180°c. The toner image  paper  is made to \\npass  between  the  hot rollers.  Because of heat and pr essure, the toner particles melt \\nand stick on to the paper. This is the last stage in printing and is called fusing.  \\n \\n \\nFeatures  \\n(i) Quality of printing is high  \\n(ii) Low printing cost  \\n(iii) Colour printing is possible  \\n(iv) It is very easy to print on envelopes, cards and other non-regular media.  \\n(v) Speed of operation is high.  \\n \\nTroubleshooting the laser printer  \\nProblem - Stains of small round black dots appear on the front or back side of the page  \\nsolution  \\n\\uf0a7 Check the type of the paper used by referring the media guide lines \\nrequired for  \\n\\uf0a7 the printer using printer manual and use the prescribed paper . \\n42  \\n  \\n \\nLine Printer  \\uf0a7 Clean the toner cartridge.  \\n\\uf0a7 If still the problem exists it is better to replace the toner Cartridge.  \\n \\nLine printer is an output device that can print one line at a time. so they are  \\nvery fast. The speed of the line printers vary from 300 to 3000 lines per minute.  \\nThere are two they are  \\n(i) Chain printer  \\n(ii) Drum printer  \\n \\n(i)      Chain Printer  \\nThe most common type of the line printer is the chain printer. In this the print \\ncharacters are mounted on a chain which moves horizontal ly .independent print \\nhammers are placed just opposite to each character but behind the paper. That is the \\npaper and ribbon placed between hammer and the character a s shown in the figure \\ngiven below.  \\nAs the character to be printed passes of each print positio n of the paper, \\ncorresponding magnetically controlled hammer strikes on t he character font, thus the paper \\nkept in between gets printed. Here all the characters in a line are printed one after other. But \\nbecause of the speed of operation it looks as if the ent ire line is printed in a single strike. The \\nspeed of line printers vary from 300 to 2000 lines per minutes. \\nFeatures \\n(i) we can different chains having different types of fonts \\n(ii) High speed \\n(iii) Operating cost low \\n(iv) Continuous operation \\n \\nDrum Printer \\nThis printer has metal drum with rows of characters engraved on it. Small print \\nhammers are arranged in front of the drum. in between the  hammer and the drum the paper \\nand the ribbon are placed as shown in the figure given b elow. \\nThe drum at constant speed and are struck by magnetically co ntrolled hammer as the \\nrequired character passes the print position. Character s do not get printed one at a line from \\nleft to right. instead they are printed in the order in whi ch they pass under the hammer. for \\nexample consider the printing of the line. \\n43  \\n Drum Printer \\n \\n \\n \\n Multi function printer(MFP ) \\nMultifunction printer is a laser or inject printer that contains the functionality of \\nmultiple devices. The different function can be called  out using an MFP are \\n(i) E-mail \\n(ii) Fax \\n(iii) Photocopier \\n(iv) Printer \\n(v) Scanner \\n \\nFeatures \\n(i) Multifunction printer improves the efficiency and produc tivity of the \\norganization. \\n(ii) It saves time and energy. \\n(iii) The cost of MFP is cheap compared to the cost of individual devices such as \\nprinter, fax, scanner, copier \\n44  \\n  Thermal Printer \\nThermal printer is a non impact printer. This uses heat  to be print the image on the \\npaper. The print head contains many small resistive heati ng pins to heat the paper or the \\nribbon. Depending on the technology used, Thermal printers ar e divided into two types. They \\nare \\n(i) Direct thermal printer \\n(ii) Thermal transfer printer \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn direct thermal printer the images are formed by heating a special paper coated wit h a \\nchemical called thermal paper. The thermal paper changes c olour when thermal print head \\nmoves over. This type of printers do not use ribbons. \\nIn thermal transfer printer the images are formed by h eating a ribbon containing wax \\nbased ink. when ribbon is heated by thermal print the ribbo n melts and transfers the image on \\nto the ordinary paper. \\nThe print head contains an array of electrical resistor heating elements. According to \\nthe character to print the microprocessor determines the  heating resisters. The ribbon consists \\nof three layers. They are \\n(i) Base material \\n(ii) Heat melting ink \\n(iii) Coating on the print side of the base material \\nAs the printhead moves over the ribbon, the heated resi stors melts the ink behind the \\nribbon forming the character over the paper. Ribbons with different colours are available to \\nprint characters in colour \\n \\nFeatures \\n(i) Thermal Printers are small in size so they do not consu me lot of scope. \\n(ii) It is available in different sized and styles. \\n(iii) Thermal printers are easy to operate and faster than ordinary printer. \\n(iv) It is less noisy. This is because, this has less moving parts . \\n(v) It is used in variety of applicants such as printing output o f ultra sound scanning. \\n45  \\n  IO Ports \\nI/O Ports are used to connect I/O devices like keyboard, mouse, printer, modem, et c. \\nwith the system.

In this display \\nis made up of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals are transpare nt substances having a property of \\nboth solid and liquid. \\n \\nLCD principles \\nMost liquid crystals contain long rod-like molecules. In their natural state the \\nmolecules are arranged (aligned) almost parallel to their long axis. By placing the liquid \\ncrystal in a finely grooved surface, the molecules arrange ment can be controlled that is, if the \\ngrooves are parallel, the alignment of molecules also be comes exactly parallel. \\n49  \\n  \\n \\nPolarizing filter-light is made to fall on the polarizing filter.The polarizing filter \\nchanges the direction of the light parallel to the axi s of the filter.Thatis, it allows only the \\nlight rays parallel to its axis. Refer Grooved plate1 and pla te2-liquid crystals are placed in the \\nfinely grooved plates are kept perpendicular. So the plate 2 molecules are arranged in north to \\nsouth direction and the plate 1 molecules are arranged in  east west direction. Because of this, \\nmolecules are forced to a twisted state of 900. Therefore, the light passing through this is \\ntwisted to 900 Polarizing filter on the bottom-this polarizer is kept perpen dicular to the top \\nfilter. Since the light rays from the polarizer is t wisted to 900 \\n \\nElectric voltage is given across the liquid crystal, t he molecules between the grooved \\nplates realign vertically. Because of this, the polari zed light is passed through without any \\ntwist. So the bottom polarizer does not allow the light to pa ss producing a dark pixel. \\nColour LCD displays use additional red, green, blue coloured fi lters over three separate LCD \\nelements to create a single multicolour pixel. \\nBy changing the across the voltage across the liquid crys tal, we can make the images to \\nappear on the screen. \\n \\n TFT displays \\n \\nThe full form of TFT is thin film transistor. This tran sistor is a special kind of field \\neffect transistor. This is made by depositing a thin film of  a semiconductor layer over a \\ndielectric such as glass. This technology is used to impro ve the image quality of LCD’s by  \\neliminating ghosting and slow response speed of image s. \\n \\nConstruction \\n50  \\n TFT LCD displays are made by placing liquid crystals in-betwe en two glass plates namely \\ncolor filter and FTF glass. \\nTFT glass has number of thin transistor (TFT)to match th e number of pixels to be \\ndisplayed. Color filter glass has color filter to genera te color. Voltage is given between the \\ncolour filter glass and TFT glass. \\n \\nWorking \\nWhen an electric voltage is applied, liquid crystals mov e according to the difference \\nin voltage between the color filter glass and the TFT glass. The direction of polarization \\nchanges depending upon the amount of voltage. As the polariz ation direction changes, more \\nor less light passes through the polarization layer on the  face of the display. \\nThe image in TFT panel is formed by a method called active  matrix driving. The figure given \\nbelow shows the structure of the active matrix LCD. \\nTFT are formed by means of a thin film of silicon deposit ed on a glass plate. The \\ntransistor acts as a pixel and the remaining area are et ched away to allow light to pass. \\nDepending on the amount of light passed, the transistors act like a storage capacitor and \\nrefresh to display the image. \\n \\n LED  displays \\nThe full form of LED is light emitting diode. This is a  special kind of diode. When \\nelectric current is applied it emits light. In LED TV, an array of LED bules are used to \\nprovide the back light to illuminate the display. The figure gi ven below shows the structure of \\nLED displays. \\nThe working principle of LED TV is same as LCD, but instead o f fluorescent back \\nlight LED light is used. LED array consumes less space a nd weight than fluorescent one. \\nTherefore, the thickness and weight of the LED T via les s than the LCD TV. LED TV gives \\nmuch more color quality than the LCD. There are two type s of LED more color quality than \\nthe LCD. There are two types of LED TV. \\n \\n(i) Edge LED lighting \\n(ii) Full LED lighting \\nEdge LED  TV consists of light emitting diodes around the edge of the back light panel. The \\nlight enters from the outer edge to the middle of the scr een. \\nFull LED  TV consists of LED’s  across the entre back. \\n \\n Graphics cards \\n \\nVideo Graphics Card \\n(VGA) Introduction \\nA video card is used to process images so they can be di splayed on your monitor. A \\ngood video card can make a big difference in the quality of your graphics, so this is \\nparticularly important if you play games or work with pho tography and video. \\n \\nDefinition \\nA video card connects to the motherboard of a computer system and generat es output \\nimages to display. Video cards are also referred to as graphics cards . Video cards include a \\nprocessing unit, memory, a cooling mechanism and connecti ons to a display device. \\n51  \\n Functions \\nFor relatively low-end computer systems, the ability to cr eate output images can be \\nintegrated into the motherboard or central processing unit ( also called CPU). However, if you \\nwant to watch movies or play games on your computer (and who doesn\\'t, at least once in a \\nwhile?), a dedicated video card greatly improves the quality of the graphics. For serious \\ngamers, a high-quality video card may just be the most impo rtant part of the computer system \\n- it\\'s a must for rendering 3D graphics in particular. \\nA video card is a printed circuit board (like a motherboar d) and contains its own \\nprocessing unit and memory. It is like a kind of computer in i tself. This essentially takes the \\nload off the motherboard\\'s CPU and memory to process image s. The processing unit on a \\nvideo card is referred to as a graphics processing unit (GPU) . This is very similar to a CPU, \\nbut its design is optimized to work with images. The memory  on a video card is very similar \\nto the regular random-access memory (or RAM) on a motherb oard. A video card connects to \\nthe motherboard of a computer system using a slot, typically  an Accelerated Graphics Port \\n(AGP) or a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI E) connection. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n SVGA Video card with the major components labeled \\nThe full form of SVGA is Super Video Graphics Array. This di splay adapter was \\nintroduced by Video Electronics Association in 1989. It is a high-resolution standard used to \\nchannel video data to a compatible visual output device-usually a  computer monitor. This is \\nactually a board umbrella term for other computer display  standards. Originally, it was just an \\nextension to the VGA standard, which was a purely IBM-defined standard also known as \\nultra video graphics array (UVGA). \\n \\nThe important features are, \\n \\n(i) It offers very high resolution of 800 x 600 and 1024 x 768 pixels i n 16 colours. \\n(ii) It supports both graphics and text mode. \\n(iii) It has 0.5 MB or 1MB Video buffer RAM. \\n(iv) It offers 32 bit interface. \\n(v) It offers wide range of colors (256 colors) \\nThe figure given below shows the pin connection \\n52  \\n  MODEM \\n \\nModem is a device which is used to connect computers with telephone system. Its full for m \\nis modulation and demodulation. It helps communication betwe en computers through the \\nexisting telephone cables. The figure given below shows th e structure of data communication \\nthrough modem. \\n \\n \\n \\n Operation \\n \\nThe digital data from the computer is converted into an alog data by the modem and is \\ntransmitted over the telephone line. The analog data rece ived from the telephone line is \\nconverted to digital by the modem and is given to computer. \\n \\nBlock diagram of modem \\n \\nUSP interface \\nThis interface is used to connect computer and modem through USP port. The user \\ncommunicates to the modem with the help this interface. \\n \\nModem Processor and Memory \\nThis unit is used to control the operations of the modem with respect to the Hayes \\ncommands. DTP switches are used to set auto answering. \\n53  \\n Modem data pump and signal processor \\nThis unit receives serial signal data and gives it to the modulator. Also it receives \\ndemodulated data from the demodulator and gives it to the mode processor. \\n \\nModulator \\nThis unit is used to convert the digital data from computer into analog data  (signal). \\nThis process is called modulation. This is done by adding a carrier signal to the digital signal. \\n \\nDemodulator \\nThis unit is used to convert the analog data (signal) from telephone syste m into digital \\ndata. This is done by eliminating the carrier signal from  analog signal. \\n \\nPhone interface \\nThis interface is used to \\n(i) Connect modem with the phone socket. \\n(ii) Dial the number for making communication. \\n(iii) Detect the incoming ring signals. \\n(iv) Connect speaker for giving voice information, ring tone, data  tone, engaged tone, \\netc. \\n \\n Power supply \\n \\n Servo stabilizer \\n \\nStabilizers are used to boost or buck the incoming voltage to give a constant output \\nvoltage. The figure given below shows the structures of a se rvo stabilizer. \\n \\nConstruction \\nServo stabilizer is made up of an auto transformer. This h as two windings wound in \\ndifferent direction as shown in the above figure. Ther e is a moving contact which moves over \\nthe windings. The moving contact is rotated by a servo motor.  The error amplifier is used to \\ngive an error voltage to the driver which the servo motor.  \\n \\nWorking \\nIn ordinary stabilizer, the transformer ha s number of tappings or windings. With the help of \\nrelays, the appropriate tapping can be switched to give output v oltage that is nearly equal to \\nthe line voltage required. \\n \\nBut in servo stabilizer there is an error amplifier to give an error there is an error amplifier to \\ngive an error voltage. This voltage is got by subtracting the dc reference voltage Vref and dc \\n54  \\n voltage rectified from the output line. This voltage driv es the servo motor in a direction to \\nboost or buck the output voltage from the secondary of the  transformer. \\nSince the error amplifier continuously monitors the output voltage, we get constant voltage \\noutput. By adjusting the value of Vref, we can set the desired output  voltage. \\n \\n \\n Uninterrupted power supply(UPS) \\n \\nUninterrupted power supplies are used to provide continuous power to the computer \\nsystem during availability of a/c and during power cut. There are two types of ups \\n \\n(i) Off – line ups \\n(ii) On – line ups \\n \\n \\n(i) Off – line ups \\n \\nblock diagram of off – line ups. \\n \\n \\nAn off- line ups is otherwise called standby power system. It uses a circuit to sense \\nthe AC input. If the sensing circuit detects any failure, it  quickly switches to the standby \\nPower system (SPS). The SPS changes the load to the inverter and it draws from the attached \\nbatteries and supplies continuous power. \\n \\nDisadvantages \\n(i) Electronic sensor takes a finite to sense power failure. So  system will shut down. \\n(ii) Switching time is high, so system will shut down. \\n(iii) Power regulation is poor \\n(iv) No protection against surges or spikes. \\n55  \\n (ii) ON- line ups \\n \\n \\nAs Shown in the above figure, batteries are always connected to the output through \\ninverter. So always it is supplying power from the battery to the  computer. Therefore on – \\nline ups’s  get never interrupted because it does not need to switch its output from main \\npower to batteries. \\n \\nWhen AC power is available, the batteries are charged thro ugh the rectifier circuit. When the \\npower fails, the charging of the battery stops and the s ystem gets a continuous supply from \\nthe battery. \\nAdvantages \\n(i) It protects against surges and dips. \\n(ii) If there is a problem with ups, we can connect the incoming ac directly to the with \\nthe help of the bypass switch. \\n(iii) It supplies smooth constant power supply. \\n(iv) It guards the computers from lighting effects. \\n \\nSurge Suppressor and spike isolators \\n \\nSurge is defined as an over voltage that lost for longer duration  say three or four nano \\nseconds. This damages the electronic equipments. Surge suppressor is a device inserted in \\nthe AC line to prevent damage to electronic equipment from over voltage. \\n \\nSpike is defined as a over voltage that lasts for shorter durat ion say one or two nano \\nseconds. This damages the electronic equipments. Spike isolator is a device inserted in the \\nAC line to prevent damage to electronic equipment from over voltage. \\n \\nOperation \\n56  \\n Normally the standard voltages in India is 240v. If the vo ltage rises above 240volts \\nthere is a problem in the input voltage. Surge or spike suppr essor helps to prevent the over \\nvoltage from damaging the equipments. The figure given belo w shows the structure of a \\nsurge or spike suppressor. \\n \\nThe main part of the surge suppressor is metal oxide varist or called MOV. This \\ncontains a piece of metal oxide material in the middle joined to the power and grounding line \\nby two semi conductors. The varistor is a variable resis tance and this depends on voltage. \\n \\nLet the threshold voltage be ± 230. When the input voltage is below this, the electrons \\nin the semi conductor flow in such a way to create a very high resistance. Therefore no \\ncurrent flows to ground. But if the input voltage exceeds the t hreshold, the electrons in the \\nsemiconductor flow in such a way to create a low resistance and allow the extra current to \\nflow to ground. When the input voltage is correct MOV does not hing. By increasing the \\nresistance, the input current is controlled. \\n \\n SMPS \\nSMPS stands for switch mode power supply. This receives 230V a .c and translates it into \\ndifferent dc levels such as + 5V, - 5V, +12 V and -12 V. \\n \\nBlock diagram and basic principle of operation of SMPS \\n \\n \\n \\nBasic principle \\nBasic principle of SMPS is, the input C voltage is firs t rectified and filtered. This \\nunregulated Dc voltage is fed to a high frequency DC- to – DC converter to produce \\nregulated Dc voltage levels. \\n \\nOperation \\n \\nThe power supplies used in computers are switched mode power supplie s. The primary \\npower received from a.c mains is rectified and filtered as  high – voltage Dc. Then it is \\nswitched on to a high frequency approximately 10 to 100 KHz by a  bipolar transistor and fed \\nto the primary side (P) of a step- down transformer. The  secondary side (S) of the transformer \\nis rectified and filtered. Then it is sent to the output of the power supply. A sample of this \\noutput is sent back as feedback for regulation as shown i n the above figure. \\n57  \\n Regulation \\n \\nThe output voltage is regulated by means of pulse width modu lation. In this the following \\nhappens \\n(i) When the output load increases, the output voltage falls. T he pulse width modulator \\ncontrol senses the change in the output voltage and increases  the ON time of the \\ntransistor. This amount of voltage will be passed through the transformer. So the \\noutput will be maintained normally. \\n \\n \\n(ii) When the output voltage increases, the pulse width modulator control senses the \\nchange and decreases the ON time of the transistor. Thi s reduces the amount of the \\nvoltage passed through the transformer. So the output will be m aintained normally. \\n \\n \\n \\n ATX Power supply connector specification \\nThe power supply connectors and pin specification are shown in  figure given below. \\n \\n \\n+3.3 V - The +3.3v DC supply is used to support the low- voltage logic. \\n \\n+5V - It is used to give power supply to the components like hard d isk, \\nfloppy disk, compact disk,  etc \\nGND  - GND  signal gives ground connection to all the devices attached \\nwith the CPU. \\n \\n+12 V -   It gives power supply to the motors in the drives. \\n \\n- 5 V - This voltage level is used for dynamic memory bias v oltage. \\n \\n-12V - This voltage level is used by the RS232C serial port. \\n58  \\n Power Good - This signal is tied to the CPU’s reset pin.

All the motherb oards comes with a BIOS \\nchip called CMOS RAM. This contains read only programs that ar e used to setup the \\ncomputer system. These programs acts as an interface b etween the raw PC hardware and the \\noperating system. Therefore every system uses a slight ly different BIOS. It is necessary to \\nsetup the BIOS during system installation. \\nOnce BIOS setup is done and saved , it is stored in the CMOS Ram . Since Ram lost \\nits contains when power is removed, a battery is added to t he PC that gives continuous power \\nof the CMOS RAM. We can change the setup settings by executin g the setup program. When \\ncomputer is switched on, a message will he displayed on th e screen to enter setup. This \\nmessage varies with different BIOS setup. Normally the mes sage press DEL to enter setup \\nwill be displayed on the screen. If this option is selec ted starts the setup utility and displays \\nthe main menu of the utility. \\nVarious setup options \\nIf we enter into BIOS CMOS setup utility, a main menu appear s on the screen . \\nArrow keys are used to select items and enter is used to run the selected item . \\nSome options lead to tables of items. These items have a value on the right side and the first \\nvalue is highlighted. By using pgUp or pgDn keys the value for each  item is selected . The \\ntable given below lists the various options. \\nOptions Usage \\nStandard setup To set date/ time , floppy drive A& B , master hard disk and \\nslave hard disk. \\nAdvanced setup To set keyboard , display , mouse support , system boot \\nsequence and drive seek. \\nChipset setup To set cache memory , seek time \\nPower Management setup This menu provides functions to set time – out value for \\nmonitor and HDD. This includes sleep mode time out. \\nSuspend mode time- out , VGA power down and HDD  \\npower down. \\nLoad fall save default This menu is used to load the BIOS values for the minimal \\nstable performance of the system. \\nLoad optimized defaults This menu is used to load the factory settings of BIOS. \\nSupervisor/ User password \\nsetting This allows is used to limit the access to the system by \\nsetting password. So every time the system is booted it asks \\nfor the password. \\nSave and exit To save all changed values to CMOS and to exit the setup. \\nExit without saving Drop all changed values and exit setup,. \\n61  \\n  Standard CMOS setup \\nStandard CMOS setup consists of basic data about our system  such as system’s date ,  \\ntime , and attached devices such as floppy drives and hard drives. It is very important to enter \\nthis data correctly. If it is not entered correctly, the  system will not boot. The following are \\nthe common entries found in the standard CMOS setup menu. \\n \\n \\n(i) Assign IRQ for VGA \\nWhen this option is enabled , the system assigns an IRQ for the video card. This speed \\nup for the transfer of data between CPU and video card. When this option is disabled, the \\nIRQ can be used for other purpose. \\n \\n(ii) Date and time \\nThis option is used to change the data and time of the system clock. \\n \\n(iii) Day light savings \\nWhen this option is enabled, the RTC (Real time calende r which maintains regular date and \\ntime) automatically adopt to the daylight savings scheme. That  is , it removes one hour on the \\nlast Sunday of October and adds it to the last Sunday of October and adds it to the last \\nSunday of April 8, this option must be enabled. \\n \\n(iv) Error halt \\nThis Option is used to decide whether the system has to be stopped when an error is \\ndetected during booting. The different options are. \\n \\n(a) No errors : The system will not stop for any errors. \\n(b) All errors : The system will be stopped when the BIOS detects a \\nnonfatal error. The error will be prompted. \\n(c) All, but keyboard : The system will be stopped for all error s except \\nkeyboard error. \\n(d) All, but disk : The system will be stopped for all errors e xcept disk error. \\n(e) All, but disk/ keyboard : The system will be stopped for all errors exceptdisk / keyboard \\nerror. \\n(v) Floppy drive A & B \\nThis option is set by selecting the type of the floppy disk in drive A and B. \\n62  \\n (vi) Hard disk \\nThis shows the characteristics of the hard disk drives on  the IDE channels. SCSI hard \\ndisk drives do not appear. Generally all modern hard drive paramet ers will be auto detected. \\nIf the hard drive cannot be auto detected the following six parameters must be given \\nmanually. \\n \\n(a) Cyl : Enter the number of cylinders on the installed har d disk. \\n(b) Heads : Enter the number of heads on the installed har d disk. \\n(c) WPre : Enter the write precompensation value as – 1 or \\nmaximum number of cylinders on the hard disk. \\n(d) LZ : Enter the cylinder used for the landing zone for olderdriv es \\nWithout auto parking feature . Set it to 0 or maximum cylinders. \\n(e) Sect/Trk : Enter the number of sectors per track .it is  normally 17 \\nFor mfm drives and 26 for RLL drives. \\n \\n(vii) Memory \\nThis option tells about the datails of the memory eleme nts. The contents are \\ndetermined by the POST (power on sell test ). The differe nt memory elements are \\n \\n(a) Base memory : The BIOS POST determines the amount of base \\nmemory installed in the system. \\n(b) Extended memory : The BIOS POST determines the amount of extended \\nmemory installed in the system. \\n(c) Other memory : This memory can be used for other applications. The \\nmost common use of this area is shadow RAM and AGP \\nbuffer area. \\n(d) Total memory : This total memory is the sum of base, extended and \\nother memory. \\n \\n(viii) Primary display \\nThis option is used to specify the type of the display th e system is using. \\n \\n Advanced BIOS setup \\n \\n63  \\n Advanced BIOS setup contains settings to boost the booting chara cteristics. This \\noptimize the performance of the memory and cache. Most o ptions found in this are not \\nimportant to the proper working of the system. But it helps th e user to make the system for \\ntheir taste. The following are the options available in the advanced BIOS setup menu. \\n \\n(i) Above 1MB memory test \\nWhen this option is enabled, the system will check only t he memory above 1 MB for errors. \\n \\n(ii) Auto configuration \\nWhen this option is enabled, the user cannot change the advanced DRAM timing options. \\n \\n(iii) Boot sector virus protection \\nThis option gives a warning whenever any virus attempts to write  into the bootsector. \\nIt is always better to enable this option. \\n \\n(iv) External cache memory \\nThis option allows the user to enable or disable the extern al cache(L2 cache)in the \\nsystem. If there is L2 cache in the system enable this  option else disable it. If this option is \\nenabled without L2 cache, the system will lock. \\n \\n(v) Internal cache memory \\nThis option allows the user to enable or disable the interna l cache (L1 cache) in the \\nCPU. If there is L1 cache in the system enable this optio n else disable it. if this option is \\nenabled without L1 cache, the system will lock. \\n \\n(vi) Floppy drive seek at boot \\nThis option is used to select whether floopy drive has to be checked at boot time or \\nnot. It is always better to disable this option for faster booting and damage to FDD R/W \\nheads. \\n \\n(vii) Memory parity check error \\nParity checking improves the integrity of data in the mem ory. When this option is \\nenabled, it gives an error message as given below when an error is detected. \\nPARITY ERROR AT OAB5:00BE SYSTEM HALTED \\nIf disabled, the memory error will go undetected. This leads to system failure. \\n \\n(viii) Memory test tick sound \\nThis option is used to generate audible tones or ticks when me mory test is going on. \\n \\n(ix) Numeric processor test \\nThis option is used to test the built in coprocessor. This must be enabled. \\n \\n(x) Password checking option \\nThis option enables the user to set password to access the system. \\n \\n(xi) Shadow memory cacheable \\nShadowing is a process of copying ROM to RAM. This process i ncrease the \\nperformance of the system. Therefore it is always to e nable this option. \\n \\n(xii) System boot sequence \\nThis option is used to set the order in which the drives are  checked by the operating \\nsystem while booting. It is always better to select C:/A: fo r faster booting. Modern BIOS \\nsupports booting from CD- ROM also. \\n64  \\n (xiii) System boot- up number lock \\nUsing this option, the user can enable or disable the numbe r lock key at boot up. \\n \\n(xiv) Wait for FI for any error \\nWhen this option is enabled, the system will halt and wa it for F1 key to be pressed for \\nany errors before proceeding. If disabled, the system dis plays an error message and \\ncontinuous with booting without waiting for a F1 input. \\n \\n Advanced chipset features \\n \\nIn todays computer systems, the chipset core logic provides number of advanced \\nfeatures. To configure the chipset number of variables are involved. The advanced chipset \\nfeatures in CMOS allows the users to tune the performance of the chipset. The following are \\nthe advanced chipset features available in CMOS. \\n \\n(i) 16 – bit memory I/O wait state \\nThis entry lists the number of wait states inserted wit h 16 – bit memory and input \\nOutput operation. Too many wait states reduce bus performance and too few wait states cause \\nbus error and system locks. It is always safe to use BIOS default value. \\n \\n(ii) 8 – bit memory, I/O wait state \\nThis entry lists the number of wait states inserted w ith 8 – bit memory and input \\noutput operation. Too many wait states reduces bus performanc e and too few wait states \\ncause bus error and system locks. It is always safe to use BIOS default value. \\n \\n(iii) Alternate bit in tag RAM \\nTag bits are used to determine the state of the information stored in the L2 cache. If \\nwe want to use write back catching method use 7+1 setting else use  8+0 setting. \\n65  \\n (iv) Automatic configuration \\nWhen this option is enabled, BIOS automatically set the settings in the advanced \\nchipset setup. \\n(v) Burst copy back option \\nThis option can be enabled or disabled, when enabled it makes the chipset to make a \\nsecond memory read. \\n(vi) Burst refresh \\nThis option performs several refresh cycles at once. \\n \\n(vii) Burst RAM  cycle \\nThis option is used to specify the timing of the burst mode r ead and write cycles \\nfrom the L2 cache. This option has two timings 4-1-1-1 and 3- 1-1-1. It is best to choose the \\nlowest setting. \\n \\n(viii) Bus mode \\nThis option is used to select the clock mode used to drive the  bus. There are two \\nmodes namely synchronous and asynchronous. It is better to choose synchronous mode. \\n \\n(ix) Concurrent refresh \\nThis option enables both the processor and refresh hardwa re to have enables to the \\nmemory at the same time. If this option is disabled, the processor has to wait until the refresh \\nhardware has finished. This slowdown the system performance . \\n \\n(x) Decoupled refresh option \\nThis feature ISA bus and RAM to refresh separately. Becaus e ISA bus refreshes \\nslowly, separating the refresh cycles cause less stra in on the CPU. it is better to enable this \\noption. \\n \\n(xi) DMA clock source \\nThis option is used to set the clock used for the DMA transf er. The maximum setting \\nfor ISA based system is 5MHz. \\n \\n(xii) DMA wait states \\nThis option is used to set the number of wait states inserted before DMA is attempted. \\nIt is better to choose lower number. \\n(xiii) Fast AT cycle \\nThis option speeds up the ISA cards data transfer. It is better to disable this option for \\nsystem stability. \\n \\n(xiv) Fast cache read/write \\nThis option improves cache performance through memory int erleaving techniques. If \\nthere are two banks of cache (64 KB or 256 KB) it is always better to enable this feature. \\n \\n(xv) Keyboard reset control \\nThis option enables CTRL-ALT-DEL reboot. \\n \\n(xvi) Memory read wait state \\nThis option is used to set the wait state in nano seconds when the cpu wants to read \\nfrom RAM. It always better to set minimum value. This value is calculated approximately \\nusing the formula. \\n(RAM speed in ns + 10)*clock speed in MHz / 1000 – 2. \\n66  \\n (xvii)  Refresh value \\nThis option is used to set the refresh value. Lower the value better the per formance. \\n \\n \\n(xviii)  Video BIOS area cachable  \\nThis option is used to improve the performance of video. \\n \\n Power Management \\nThe CMOS setup has number of power management features to save the energy when \\nthe system is idle. Even through PC’s consume less powe r, this feature makes the PC more \\npower efficient. The following are the power management o ptions in CMOS. \\n(i) Doze timer \\nThis option is used to set the time delay before the syst em reduce its 80% activity. \\nTen to twenty minutes is the preferred time. \\n \\n(ii) Green timer of main board \\nThis option is used to set the time before a CPU of an i dle system will shutdown. \\n \\n(iii) HDD standby timer \\nThis option is used to set the shutdown time of HDD after the system is idle. \\n \\n \\n(iv) Modem use IRQ \\nThis option is used to enter the IRQ assigned to modems. If there is an activity on the \\nselected IRQ the system will be in awaken mode. This feature is called wake on ring. \\n(v)Power management scheme \\nThis option is used to define the amount of power management in the system by the \\nuser. The options are \\n\\uf076 Disabled - Global power management will be disabled. \\n\\uf076 User define - User can define their own power management settings. \\n\\uf076 Min saving - Predefined timer values are used when all tim ers are in \\nmaximum value. \\n\\uf076  Max saving - Predefined timer values are used when all time rs are in \\nminimum value. \\n \\n(vi) Standby timer \\nThis option is used to set the timer delay before the syst em reduces its 92% of its \\nactivity. \\n \\n(vii) Suspend switch \\nThis option is used to enable or disable hardware suspend switch on the motherboard. \\n \\n(viii) Suspend timer \\nThis option is used to set the time after which the system  goes into the most inactive \\nstate. When this option is enabled, the system requires a warm up period for cpu, hardware \\nand monitor to go on line. \\n \\n(ix) Video off option \\nThis option is used to turn off the display. The differe nt options are \\n\\uf076 Always on – BIOS will not turn off the display \\n\\uf076 Suspend off – Display is off when system is in suspend mode. \\n\\uf076 Suspend standby off – Display is off when system is in standby or suspend m ode. \\n\\uf076 All modes off - Display is off when system is in doze, standby or suspend mode. \\n67  \\n  PC BIOS Communication \\nAt the end of the system bootup, the operating system is  located and loaded into the \\nmemory. After loading, the operating system takes the con trol of the system. The operating \\nsystem takes the control of the system. The operating system acts as an interface between the \\napplication programs and the hardware through the help of BI OS. There are two types of PC \\nBIOS communication depending an the operating system used. T hey are \\n(i) BIOS – DOS  communication \\n(ii) BIOS – Windows communication \\n \\n(i) BIOS – DOS communication \\nThe hardware BIOS – DOS interaction in a PC system is shown in the above  figure. BIOS is \\nthe first software layer that covers the PC hardware. I t is also called a firmware since it is \\nclosely linked with hardware for I/O operations. DOS occupies  the next layer. The user \\nprograms and commands are given to the hardware(CPU, memor y etc)through BIOS by \\nDOS. \\n \\n(ii) BIOS – Windows communication \\nThe hardware BIOS- DOS  – WINDOWS interaction in a PC system is shown in \\nthe figure given below. DOS  can run only some programs. To widen the application \\nWINDOWS was developed. This is placed between the DOS and appli cation program. All \\nDOS programs can be able to run under all versions of windows . Windows simplify the user \\ntask into greater extent. The later versions from windo ws 95 is a full operating system that \\ndoesn’t  need DOS. \\n Upgrading BIOS \\nUpgrading the BIOS is a process of changing the existing in the system to a higher \\nversion. The BIOS contains essential codes, which allows t he computer to boot and provide \\ncritical interface between the hardware and software. B IOS is encoded in a chip and is called Application Program \\nDOS  \\nBIOS \\nHardware \\nApplication program \\nWINDOWS \\nDOS  \\nBIOS \\nHardware \\n68  \\n CMOSRAM. Earlier versions of systems had removable BIOS chip. Now a days \\nmotherboards come with fused BIOS chips. \\nSuppose if a user wants to add more features to the existing BI OS, the only way is \\nto upgrade the BIOS. Upgradition of BIOS is possible in the followi ng ways. \\n(i) If the BIOS chip is removable replace the old BIOS chip by  a new one. \\n(ii) If the BIOS chip is fused, it can be upgraded with the help of t he upgraded BIOS \\nversions provided in the BIOS manufactures web sites. The upgra ded versions can \\nbe downloaded in the system and can be programmed in the BIOS chip.  \\n \\n Flash BIOS \\nFlash BIOS is nothing but a BIOS utility stored in a elect rically erasable \\nprogrammable read only memory (EEPROM) chip. This is norm ally fused in the \\nmotherboard and can be erased and reprogrammed. \\n \\nThe main use of flash BIOS is, the user does not have to go a new BIOS chip for \\nupgradition. Instead, the user can upgrade the flash BIOS by flas hing (storing) the new \\nversion of the BIOS in the EEPROM chip. \\n \\n POST \\n Definition \\nPost is a series of program routine in the motherboard ROM firmware and is used \\nto check the system components. This was introduced by IBM i n 1981. When we switch on \\nthe computer, POST is executed first and automatically perform s a series of tests that check \\nthe various components in the system. The components t ested by POST are CPU, ROM, \\nmotherboard support circuitry, memory and major peripher als. \\nWhenever a faulty component is found, it gives an error or warning message. \\nThere are two types of error message. They are \\n(i) Audio error codes \\n(ii) Display error codes \\nThe POST programs are stored in the final 8KB area of the  1 MB BIOS ROM. \\nAt once the computer is switched on or reset, the micropr ocessor starts processing POST \\nfrom memory address FFFF0. \\n \\n IPL hardware(Initial program load) \\n \\nIPL hardware is the minimum hardware needed to begin POST successfully. \\nAt once the computer is switched on of reset, the IPL hardware transfers control to POST. \\nAfter completion of all tests, POST transfers control to the bootstrap program. Boot strap \\nprogram can be either read form hard or floppy disk. The  IPL hardwares are \\n(i) Power supply \\n(ii) Clock logic \\n(iii) Bus controller \\n(iv) Micro processor \\n(v) Address latches \\n(vi) Data bus and control bus transceivers \\n(vii) BIOS \\n(viii) ROM address decode logic \\n \\n \\n POST test sequence \\nTable below the tests performed by POST. It also gives the  address if an error is \\nencountered in the sequence of the test. The half address tells us how far POST has \\n69  \\n progressed and indicates where the problem lies. This halt a ddress can be read from the I/O \\nslot address signals. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSequence \\nNO  \\nTest  \\nActivities  \\nHalt address \\n1.

POST will load the operating \\nsystem from the disk if not present, it \\nis loaded, it is loaded from hard disk.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Beep codes and error message \\nPOST error codes are audio codes consisting of .various bee ps that identify the \\nfaulty component. If any problem is detected during start of the system, the different series of \\naudio codes are sounded. The table given below lists the diff erent audio codes and its related \\nproblem area. \\n \\nBeep code Error message \\nNo beep Power supply \\nContinuous beep Power supply, memory \\nRepeating short beep Power supply \\n1 long and 1 short beep Motherboard \\n1 long and 2 short beep Video adapter card \\n1 short beep and bad/no display Video cable and / or display \\n1 short beep and no boot Disk cable, adapter or disk \\n \\n Diagnostic software and viruses \\n \\n Computer viruses \\nViruses are malicious computer programs. These programs a ttach themselves as \\nexecutable code and infect the user’s computer. They can re plicate themselves on the  \\ncomputer and damage data or executable files without the users knowledge. \\nThese programs hide copies of themselves in various locat ions such as boot sector, \\nFAT, partition table, program files, hidden files and data types . Virus programs attaches itself \\nwith other programs and spreads from one machine to another.  The full form of various is \\nvital information resources under seize. \\nWith the help of the following, we can feel the presence of virus in our system. \\n(i) Programs take longer time to load \\n(ii) Takes more disk space than normal operation \\n(iii) Disk volume name changes \\n(iv) Hidden files or bad sector appears \\n(v) Size of executable files changed \\n(vi) Unexpected changes to file date and time \\n(vii) Less free memory available than usual \\n(viii) Random, unexplained error occurring. \\n71  \\n  Precautions to be taken to avoid viruses \\n(i) Regularly execute CHKDISK and check the size of the base  RAM of the memory \\n(ii) Important files or data should be given read only attribut es. \\n(iii) Note down the size of the COMMAND, COM file. It should not change. \\n(iv) Check regularly for hidden files and bad sectors. \\n(v) Do not allow outside floppy disks in our computer. \\n(vi) Install a good anti virus software in the machine. \\n(vii) Take backups of important files and data. \\n(viii) Use separate directories for program and data files. \\n(ix) Before installing new programs, carefully check for viruses.  \\n \\n Anti- virus software \\nAnti-virus software or scanners are programs which are used to search the system \\narea as well as program files for known virus infections. Th ese are created as a response to \\nknown viruses. No virus scanner is 100% effective. There are two basic types of virus \\nscanners. \\n(i) On demand  \\nThese scanners must be initialized through some manual or automatic process. \\nOnce started, it searches the entire drive or system for known viruses and tells about \\ninfection. \\n \\n(ii) Memory resident or on access  \\nMemory resident virus detection program will be loaded in RAM during system is \\nbooting and is active as long as the system is on. Whene ver a program is accessed it checks \\nfor the known viruses and tells about the infection. \\nThe presently available anti- virussoftware’s are  \\n(i) Microsoft antivirus \\n(ii) Norton antivirus \\n(iii) Norton doctor \\n(iv) Symantec’s  Norton antivirus \\n(v) K7 Anti-virus \\n(vi) Avira \\n \\n \\n \\nNorton \\nNorton is antivirus software. It is used to protect the computer resources from \\nknown viruses. With the help of this we can detect and clean the known viruses. Since new \\nviruses are evolving every day, the Norton developers introduce d number of versions of \\nsoftware. The important versions are \\n(i) Norton antivirus 2000 \\n(ii) Norton antivirus 2001 \\n(iii) Norton antivirus 2002 \\n(iv) Norton antivirus 2003 \\n(v) Symante’c  Norton antivirus 2004. \\nThe latest version supports all type of operating systems  such as windows XP, \\nXP Pro,XP home etc. the important features are \\n(i) Automatically removes viruses, worms and trojan horses. \\n(ii) Scans and cleans both incoming and outgoing e- mail mess ages \\n(iii) Detects and blocks viruses in instant message attachments. \\n(iv) Downloads new virus protection updates automatically to protect against new \\nthreads. \\n72  \\n (v) Worm blocking facility worms such as Nimda in outgoing mail \\n(vi) Script blocking facility defends against fast moving script based viruses such as I \\nLOVE YOU and ViratKohli etc.. \\n(vii) Worm blocking and script blocking can detect new threads even before virus \\nprotection updates are created for them. \\n \\n Identify the signature of the virus \\nAntivirus scanners are used to protect against known viruses. The se scanners use a \\nfile called signature file to detect the viruses. A signature file is simply a database that lists \\nall known viruses, along with their specific attributes. The attributes are \\n(i) Samples of each virus code \\n(ii) The type of files it infects \\n(iii) Any other useful information \\nWhen the scanner checks a file, it checks whether any of  the code within the \\nFile matches any of the entries in the signature file. If it matches, it detects the virus and \\ninforms it, for necessary action. \\n \\n Firewalls \\nFirewall is a protection barrier (software) between the n etwork of computers or a \\ncomputer and outside world(internet). The figure given below shows the structures of firewall \\nprotected network. \\nAs shown in the above figure, firewall software is loaded in  a separate computer. \\nAll traffic between the local network or computer is made th rough the firewall. The firewall \\ninspects all the data coming in and out of the network using a predefined security checks. So \\nit act as a guard to protect the network or a computer from unwant ed codes or viruses \\nreaching the computer or network from internet. The import ant types of firewalls are \\n \\n(i) Packet filtering gateway \\nThis is the simplest firewall. This contains filters to screen t he incoming and \\noutgoing traffic this for unwanted codes. \\n \\n(ii) IP packet screening routers \\nIn this, the firewall contains number of predefined screeni ng rules. The rules include \\nallowed IP addresses and allowed incoming message protocol such as (TCP, UDP, ICMP). \\nSo all the incoming or outgoing information are checked wit h these rules. If they match the \\nrules they will be allowed to pass. All others will be scree ned. \\n73  \\n  Latest diagnostic softwares \\n \\n1. Process Explorer \\nIt is a small utility available for free.

The effectiveness \\nof a data communication system depends on three fundamental  characteristics: \\n1. Delivery: The system must deliver data to the correct destination. Dat a must be \\nreceived by the intended device or user and only by that devi ce or user. \\n2. Accuracy: The system must deliver data accurately. Data that have altered in \\ntransmission and left uncorrected are unusable. \\n3. Timeliness: The system must deliver data in a timely manner. Data delive red late are \\nuseless. In the case of audio, video and voice data, timely delivery means delivering \\ndata as they are produced. This kind of delivery is called rea l-time transmission. \\n \\n Components of a data communication: \\nA data communication is made up of five components. See fi gure below. \\n \\n \\nComponents of a data communication \\n \\n \\n1. Message: The message is the information (data) to be communicated. It can consist \\nof text, numbers, pictures, sound or video or any combination of these. \\n2. Sender: The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a computer, \\nworkstation, telephone handset, video camera and so on.  \\n88  \\n 3. Receiver: The receiver is the device that receives the message. I t can be a computer, \\nworkstation, telephone handset, video camera and so on.  \\n4. Medium: The transmission medium is the physical path by which a message travels \\nfrom sender to receiver. It can consist of twisted pair  wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic \\ncable, laser or radio waves (terrestrial or satellite microwave). \\n5. Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communicatio n. It represents \\nan agreement between the communicating devices. Without a protocol, two devices \\nmay be connected, but not communicating. \\n \\n \\n Data flow: \\nData flow or transmission mode is used to define the direction of signal flow between \\ntwo linked devices. There are three types of transmission modes: \\n1. Simplex \\n \\n2. Half duplex and \\n \\n3. Full duplex. \\n \\n \\n \\nTypes of transmission modes \\n Simplex: \\nIn simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional. Only one of the two stations \\non a link can transmit and the other can only receive. See figure below. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSimplex \\nExample: Keyboard and monitor \\n89  \\n  Half duplex: \\nIn half duplex mode, each station can both transmit and r eceive, but not in the same \\ntime. When one device is sending, the other can only receive  and vice versa (See figure). In a \\nhalf duplex transmission mode, the entire capacity of a channel is taken over by the \\ntransmitting device. \\n \\n \\nHalf duplex \\n \\n \\nExample: Walkie-talkies. \\n \\n \\n Full duplex: \\nIn full duplex mode, also called duplex, both stations can tr ansmit and receive \\nsimultaneously. In this mode, signals going in either dir ection share the capacity of the link. \\nThis sharing can occur in two ways : either the link must c ontain two physically separate \\ntransmission paths, one for sending and the other for r eceiving, or the capacity of the channel \\nis divided between the signals travelling in opposite directi ons. See figure below. \\n \\n \\nFull duplex \\n \\n \\nExample: Telephone network. \\n90  \\n  Topologies: \\nThe topology of a network is the geometric representation  of the relationship of all the \\nlinks and linking devices (usually called nodes) to each other. Ther e are four basic topologies \\npossible: bus, star, ring and mesh. See figure below. \\n \\n \\nBasic topologies \\nThese topologies describe how the devices in a network are  interconnected rather than \\ntheir physical arrangement. When choosing a topology, we have to consider the relative \\nstatus of the devices to be linked. i.e. whether the devices share the link equally (peer to peer) \\nor one device controls the traffic and others must transm it through it (primary-secondary). \\nRing and mesh topologies are peer to peer transmission, sta r is primary-secondary. A bus \\ntopology is equally convenient for either. \\n Bus topology: \\nThe bus topology consists of computers connected by a sing le cable called a backbone \\nas in figure below. All the computers on the bus share in it s capacity. This is the simplest \\nmethod for connecting computers. In a bus environment, 10Ba se2 or 10Base5 cable is used, \\nand because all devices share the same bandwidth, the m ore devices, the slower the network. \\nIn fact, it is probably not feasible for use with more than  10 workstations. \\nBus topology \\nIn a bus topology, the \\ncomputers only listen for data being \\nsent to them, they do not forward the \\ndata. This is called a passive topology . \\nA generated signal moves from one \\nend of the bus to the other end. To \\nprevent the signal from bouncing back \\nand forth, a terminator is located at \\neach end of the cable. \\nBecause all the computers are \\nconnected by the same cable, if one \\nsegment has a problem, the whole \\nnetwork is down. \\n91  \\n Advantages : \\n1. Cabling is easy to work with and extend with less cost. \\n2. Less cabling because all computers are in one line. \\n3. Layout is simple. \\n \\n \\nDisadvantages: \\n1. Fault isolation is difficult because one break affects the entire netwo rk. \\n2. One break or bad termination brings down the entire network . \\n3. Heavy traffic can slow it down because all machines share same bandwidth. \\n \\n \\n Star topology: \\nIn star topology, the computers are connected to a centra lized hub by a cable segment \\nas in figure. They require more cabling than ring or bus topol ogies, but each computer is \\nconnected to the hub by its own cable. Therefore if one computer connection goes down, it \\ndoes not affect the rest of the network. Because each works tation has its own connection, it is \\nmuch easier to move them around or connect them to other networks. 10BaseT-100BaseFX \\ncan be used a star topology. A star topology can support up to 1024 workstations, but it may \\nnot be feasible to connect them all to the same logica l network. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStar topology Advantages : \\n1. The entire network is not disrupted \\nwhen adding or removing computers. \\n2. If one computer fails, it does not affect \\nthe rest of the network. \\n3. It is easy to manage and monitor. \\nDisadvantages : \\n1. It requires more cabling because each \\nmachine needs a separate connection \\nto the central hub. \\n2. If the central hub fails, it brings down \\nthe entire network. \\n92  \\n  Ring topology: \\nIn ring topology, each computer connects directly to th e next one in line, forming a \\ncircle as shown in figure below. Data travels in a clockw ise direction and each computer \\naccepts the information intended for it and passes on th e information for other computers. It \\nuses a token, which is actually a small packet, to send information. Every  computer in the \\nring is responsible for either passing the token or creatin g a new one. Token passing uses the \\ntoken, or series of bits, to grant devicepermission to transmit o ver the network. When a \\ncomputer has information to send, it modifies the token an d passes it on. After the token \\nreaches its final destination, it lets the sender know it has arrived safely, the sender then \\nmakes a new token, and the process starts over. Most ri ng networks use fiber or twisted pair \\nas the medium. \\nThis is known as active topology because each workstation is responsible for sending \\non the token. Currently many ring networks implement a dual- ring network or small hub to \\naddress this problem. \\nAdvantages: \\n1. Network performance is consistent due to token passing. \\n2. The length of the cable required is short. \\n3. Equal access is granted to all computers. \\nDisadvantages : \\n1. Unidirectional traffic. \\n2. If one computer fails, it brings down \\nthe entire network. \\n3. The entire network is disrupted when \\nadding or removing computers. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRing topology \\n \\n \\n Mesh topology: \\nIn a mesh topology, all devices are connected to each other  more than once to create \\nfault tolerance as in figure below. A single device or cable failure will not affect the \\nperformance because the devices are connected by more th an one means. This is more \\nexpensive as it requires more hardware and cabling. This type o f topology can also be found \\nin enterprise –wide networks with routers connected to other routers for fault tolerance. \\n93  \\n So, a mesh topology is usually implemented in a limited fas hion, for example, as a \\nbackbone connecting the main computers of a hybrid netwo rk that can include several other \\ntopologies. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMesh topology Advantages : \\n1. The use of dedicated links guarantees \\nthat each connection can carry its own \\ndata load. \\n2. In mesh topology, if one link becomes \\nunusable, it does not affect the entire \\nsystem. \\n3. Another advantage is privacy or \\nsecurity. When every message sent \\ntravels along a dedicated line, only the \\nintended recipient sees it. \\n4. The point- to-point links make fault \\nidentification and fault isolation easy. \\n \\n \\nDisadvantages: \\n1. Because, every device must be connected to every other device, installation and \\nreconfiguration are difficult. \\n2. The sheer bulk of the wiring can be greater than the available space. \\n3. The hardware required to connect each link can be prohibitively expensive. \\n \\n \\n Hybrid topology: \\nA network that combines several other topologies as subne t works linked together in a \\nlarge topology. For instance, in star bus topology, computers are connected to hubs in a star \\nformation and then the hubs are connected via bus topolog y. Refer figure below. Although it \\nis more expensive to implement, longer distances can be covered and networks can be \\nisolated more easily. \\n94  \\n   \\n \\nstar bus topology star ring topology \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn a star ring topology , data is sent in a circular motion around the star. R efer figure \\nabove. This eliminates the single point of failure that ca n occur in a ring topology. It uses \\ntoken passing data transmission with the physical layout of a star. \\nLarge networks are typically organized as hierarchies. A hier archical organization \\nprovides advantages such as ease of management, flexibility  and a reduction in unnecessary \\ntraffic. In a hierarchical network structure, a high-speed bac kbone of Fiber optic cable usually \\nconnects the servers. \\n \\nAdvantages: \\n1. Fault detection and trouble shooting is easy. \\n2. It is easy to add new devices or network. \\n \\n \\nDisadvantages: \\n1. It is difficult to design. \\n2. The hubs used to connect two different networks are very expensive \\n \\n \\nComparison of LAN topologies: \\n \\nTopology Reliability Hardware cost Performance \\nBus A cable fault may affect \\nthe entire network; \\nlocating the fault is \\ndifficult Limited cabling; low \\ncost; Easy installation Shared medium, \\nlimited performance \\n95  \\n Star Fault in one computer \\ndoes not affect others; \\nEasy to locate the fault. \\nFailure of hub affects the \\nentire network High cost of wiring and \\ncentral hub Sharing, or switching \\npossible; Easy \\nexpansion :addition \\nnew nodes without \\ndisturbing the network \\nRing One failure affects entire \\nnetwork; difficult to \\nlocate the fault Single cable with \\nrepeaters Single medium limits \\nperformance \\nMesh Individual cable problem \\ndoes not affect the \\nnetwork. Alternate routes \\nare available in case of \\nfailure of one node Heavy wiring; expensive Good; Alternative \\nroutes \\n \\n \\n \\n Networks: \\n Definition \\nA network is a group of computers that can communicate with each other to share \\ninformation. When computers communicate with each other,  they can share resources. These \\nresources can be data, applications or hardware. We can con nect two computers together with \\na cable, which results in a simple network. \\n Types of Networks: \\nThere are primarily three categories of networks namely L ocal Area Networks (LAN), \\nMetropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN). T he category of a \\nnetwork is determined by its size, ownership, the distance it covers and its physical \\narchitecture. \\n \\n \\n \\nTypes of Networks \\n96  \\n  LAN: \\nA local area network (LAN) is usually owned and links the devices in a single office, \\nbuilding or campus. \\n \\n \\n \\nDepending on the needs of an organization and type of technol ogy used, a LAN can \\nbe as simple as 2 PCs and a printer in someone’s home o ffice or it can extend throughout  \\ncompan yand include voice sound and video peripherals. Currently LAN’s  size is limited to  \\nfew kilometres. \\nLANs are designed to allow resources to be shared between PCs  or workstations. The \\nresources to be shared can include hardware (e.g. a printer),  software (e.g. a application \\nprogram) or data. \\nIn addition to size, LANs are distinguished from other types  of networks by their \\ntransmission media and topology. In general, a given LAN will use only one type of \\ntransmission medium. The most common LAN topologies ar e bus, ring and star. \\nTraditionally, LANs have data rates in 4 to 16 Mbps range. Today, the speeds are \\nincreasing and can reach 100 Mbps with gigabit systems in de velopment. \\n \\n MAN: \\nA Metropolitan area network (MAN) is designed to extend over  an entire city. It may \\nbe a single network such as a cable television network or it may be a means of connecting a \\nnumber of LANs into a large network so that resources may be shared LAN- to-LAN as well \\nas device- to-device. For example, a company can use MAN to connect the LANs in all its \\noffices throughout a city. \\n97  \\n  \\n \\nMetropolitan area network \\nA MAN can be wholly owned and operated by a private company or  it may be a \\nservice provided by a public company such as a local telephone company. \\n WAN: \\nA wide area network (WAN) provides long distance transmissio n of data, voice, \\nimage and video information over large geographical areas tha t may comprise a country, \\ncontinent or even the whole world. \\nIn contrast to LANs (depend on their own hardware for transmi ssion), WANs may utilize \\npublic, leased or private communication devices, usually in com binations and can therefore \\nspan unlimited number of miles. A WAN that is wholly owned and used by single company \\nis often referred to as an enterprise network. \\n \\n \\nWide area network \\n98  \\n In addition to the above three categories of network, a user can use other types of \\nnetworks as required by his application. Some of them are \\n \\nCAN:  Controller Area Network – used in automobiles \\nHAN: Home Area Network – networking of home appliances \\nSAN: Networking of servers used for storing same information around the world.  \\n \\n \\n CAN:  \\n \\nA Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standa rd designed to allow \\nmicrocontrollers and devices to communicate with each othe r in applications without a host \\ncomputer . The devices that are connected by a CAN network are typi cally sensors, actuators, \\nand other control devices. These devices are connected to the  bus through a host processor, a \\nCAN controller, and a CAN transceiver. \\nCAN is a multi-master serial bus standard for connecting Electronic Control Units \\n[ECUs] also known as nodes. Two or more nodes are required on  the CAN network to \\ncommunicate. The complexity of the node can range from a simple I/O device up to an \\nembedded computer with a CAN interface and sophisticated software. The node m ay also be \\na gateway allowing a standard computer to communicate over a USB or  Ethernet port to the \\ndevices on a CAN network. \\nAll nodes are connected to each other through a two wire bus. High speed CAN is \\nusually used in automotive and industrial applications where the  bus runs from one end of the \\nenvironment to the other. \\n \\n \\nCAN bus Node \\n99  \\n Each node requires: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Central processing unit, microprocessor, or host process or \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 CAN controller \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 CAN Transceiver \\uf020\\nEach node is able to send and receive messages, but not simult aneously. A message \\nor Frame consists primarily of the ID (identifier), which represents the priority of the \\nmessage, and up to eight data bytes. A CRC,  acknowledge slot [ACK] and other overhead are \\nalso part of the message. \\n \\n HAN: \\nA Home Area Network (HAN) contained within a user\\'s home that  connects a \\nperson\\'s digital devices, from multiple computers and thei r peripheral devices to telephones, \\nVCRs, televisions, video games, home security systems, sma rt appliances, fax machines and \\nother digital devices that are wired into the network. \\nThis can be used to increase the quality of life inside the  home in a variety of ways, \\nsuch as automation of repetitious tasks, increased personal  productivity, enhanced home \\nsecurity, and easier access to entertainment. \\n \\nThe components required for Home Area Network are:  \\n \\n1. A modem exposes an Ethernet interface to a service provider\\'s native \\ntelecommunications infrastructure . \\n2. A router manages network layer connectivity between a WAN and the HA N. \\n3. A network switch is used to allow devices on the home network to talk to one another \\nvia Ethernet. \\n4. A wireless access point is required for connecting wireless devices to a network. \\n5. A home automation controller is used to connect the devices such as light bulbs and \\nlocks. \\n \\n Concepts on Internet, Intranet and Extranet: \\n \\n Internet: \\n \\nInternet is a worldwide, publicly accessible computer network of interconnected \\ncomputer networks (internetwork) that transmit data using the  standard Internet Protocol (IP) . \\nInternet is the world\\'s largest Internetwork. The Internet is a collection of interconnected  \\n100  \\n computer networks, linked by copper wires, fiber-optic cables, w ireless connections, etc. The \\nservices accessible via the Internet include World Wide W eb, email, file sharing, remote \\nadministration, e-banking, online gaming, online shopping and education etc.  \\n \\n1. Work on the internet was started in the late 80s but it s tarted to get popular in the \\nworld in early 90s.  \\n2. There is no central governing body of the internet and it comprises the various \\nautonomous networks that operate as a medium of interconnection. \\n3. Internet is a clustered system of interrelated computer networks that uses a standard \\nInternet protocol (IP) or transmission control protocol (TCP) network. \\n4. It is a global network of millions of private, public and organiza tional network. It \\ncarries a massive range of informational resources and data in form of HTTP \\n(Hypertext Markup language) documents and applications through W orld Wide Web \\n(WWW). \\n5. At present, the one-third population of the world is using the  internet directly or \\nindirectly. \\n \\n Intranet: \\n \\nAn intranet is a private network that is contained within an enterprise. It may consist \\nof   many   interlinked   local   area   networks   and   use   any Wide    Area    Network \\n(WAN) technologies for network connectivity. The main purpose of an intranet is to share \\ncompany information and computing resources among employe es. Intranet is a private \\nInternetwork, which is usually created and maintained by a private  organization. The content \\navailable inside Intranet is intended only for the members of that organization (usually \\nemployees of a company).  \\n \\n1. Intranet is a computer network system which refers to th e network of a specific \\norganization. \\n2. It is a private network where authenticated users of the o rganization can access the \\ndatabase system, search engines, directory and can distribute documents and \\nworkflow. \\n3. Employees can make interactive communication in shape of chatting, audio and \\nvideoconferencing, groupware and teleconferencing. \\n101  \\n 4. The benefit of Intranet is that low development and main tenance cost. It is also the \\ntype of internet that is restricted to the internal environment of an organization only. \\n5. Intranet started to grow across the world after the internet when some la rge \\norganizations started to develop their own internal intern et system that was later on \\nnamed as an intranet. The main aim of the intranet is to ensure the secure \\ncollaboration, communication and team working in any organi zation. \\n \\n \\n Extranet: \\n \\nAn extranet can be viewed as part of a company\\'s intranet t hat is extended to users \\noutside the company like suppliers, vendors, partners, customer s, or other business associates. \\nExtranet is required for normal day- to-day business activities. For example, placing order to \\nregistered vendors, Billing & Invoices, Payments, Joint Ve ntures, Product Brochures for \\nPartners, Discounted price lists for partners etc.  \\n \\n1. Extranet is a kind of computer network that allows the outsi de users to access the \\nIntranet of organization. \\n2. This system basically allows the outside users of an organization, like partners, \\nsuppliers, vendors and other stakeholders to remain in touch with the activities of \\norganization. Information and data access are performed th rough a proper account or \\nlink system. \\n3. This is a best network system to keep in touch with market posi tion and share a large \\namount of data to partners in a timely manner. \\n4. Also, conducting new training programs and discussing the products c atalogs wi th \\npartners can be easily done without bearing too much cost  of travelling. \\n5. After setting the extranet, the users can then send privat e messages by using the \\npublic network system through the most enhanced encryption and  security \\ntechnologies. The information in all way is accessible  through the intranet of an \\norganization. \\n \\n \\n Client-Server network: \\nIn this type of network, there are two components namely \\n1. client and \\n2. server \\n102  \\n Client: \\nA client is a program running on the local machine requesting service from a server. \\nA client program is finite, which means it is started by the user or another application \\nprogram and terminates when the service is complete. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nClient-Server network \\nServer: \\nA server is a program running in the remote machine providing se rvice to the client. \\nWhen it starts, it opens the door for incoming requests fr om clients, but it never initiates a \\nservice until it is requested to do so. A server program is an infinite program. When it starts, \\nit runs infinitely unless a problem arises. It waits for the incoming requests from clients. \\nWhen a request arrives, it responds to the request. \\n \\nAdvantages: \\n1. Centralized resources \\n2. Excellent security \\n \\n \\nDisadvantages: \\n1. Expensive – Dedicated server \\n2. Dependency – When server fails entire network crashes \\n \\n \\n Peer to Peer Networks: \\nA peer- to-peer network is a simple type of network. In a peer- to-peer network, all \\ncomputers are equal and share resources and use resources fr om each other (file sharing, \\nperipheral sharing etc). Peer- to-peer networks are used mainly for small and medium LANs.  \\n \\n \\nServer \\nC2 C3 C1 \\nC4 \\n103  \\n C1  C2 \\n \\n \\n \\nPeer to Peer Networks \\nAdvantages: \\n1. Economical – No dedicated server \\n2. Simple installation setup \\n \\n \\nDisadvantages: \\n1. No central backup for files \\n2. Poor security \\n \\n \\n Network devices: \\n Switches: \\nSwitches are becoming popular than hubs when it comes to c onnecting desktops. \\nSwitches operate at the Data Link Layer of the OSI model . Their packet-forwarding decisions \\nare based on MAC addresses. That is, a switch simply looks  at each packet and determines \\nfrom a physical address (MAC address) which device a packet i s intended for and then \\nswitches it out toward that device. \\nSwitches allow LANs to be segmented, thereby increasing t he amount of bandwidth \\nthat goes to each device. The basic functions of a swit ch include filtering and forwarding \\nframes, learning media access control (MAC) addresses a nd preventing loops. \\nSwitch \\n104  \\n A frame arrives at port 2 and is stored in the buffer. The CPU and control unit, using the \\ninformation in the frame, consult the switching table t o find the output port. The frame is then \\nsent to port 5 for transmission. \\nSwitches are made based on two different strategies : \\n \\n1. Store-and-forward and \\n2. Cut-through. \\n \\nA store-and-forward switch stores the frame in the input buffer until the whole \\npacket has arrived . Hence the data transfer is delayed. \\nA cut-through switch , on the other hand, forwards the packet to the output buffer as \\nsoon as the destination address is received. So the data tr ansfer is not delayed. \\nFeatures: \\n \\n(i) Switches increase the bandwidth of available network. \\n \\n(ii) Switches reduce the workload on individual computers. \\n \\n(iii) Switches increase the network performance. \\n \\n(iv) Switches decrease data packet collision. \\n \\n(v) Switches have their own operating system. \\n \\n \\n Routers: \\nRouters operate at the Network layer of the OSI model. They forward information to \\nits destination on the network or the Internet. Routers mai ntain tables that are checked each \\ntime a packet needs to be redirected from one interface to an other. The routes may be added \\nmanually to the routing table or may be updated automatically using various protocols. \\nRouters are primarily used to segment traffic but they have additional useful features. \\nOne of the best is its ability to filter packets either by  source address, destination address, \\nprotocol or port. A router may create or maintain a tabl e of the available routes and their \\nconditions and then use this information along with dis tance and cost algorithms to determine \\nthe best route for a given packet. \\n105  \\n  \\n \\n \\nRouter \\n \\n \\nOn the Internet, a router is a device that determines th e next network point to which a \\npacket should be forwarded toward its destination. The router is connected to at least two \\nnetworks and decides which way to send each information packet based on its current \\nunderstanding of the state of the networks to which it is conn ected. \\nA router is located at any gateway, including each interne t point of presence. Many \\ntimes the connection from a router to the internet is through a device called Channel Service \\nUnit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU). The router is then internal, connected to a LAN port on \\na switch. \\n \\nTypes of routers: \\nRouters are divided into two categories:  \\n1. Wired and \\n2. Wireless. \\n \\n \\nWired Routers:  \\nWired routers can be used to do several different types of things. They can be used to \\nconnect two different computers or to connect two computers  to the Internet. They can also \\nbe used to create a phone connection. If we are using Voice  over IP (VoIP) technology, then \\nwe will need a broadband router to connect Internet to phone. These are often a special type \\nof modem that will have both Ethernet and phone jacks. Us ually we must purchase the router \\nfrom the company in order to obtain the service.  \\n106  \\n Wireless Routers:  \\nWireless routers connect to the modem and create a wir eless signal in home or office. \\nSo, any computer within range can connect to the wireless ro uter and use broadband Internet \\nfor free. The only way to keep anyone from connecting to the system is to secure the router \\nby using the security key.  \\n \\n \\n Gateways: \\nGateways potentially operate in all seven layers of the OSI model. A gateway is a \\nprotocol converter. A route by itself transfers, accepts a nd relays packets only across \\nnetworks using similar protocols. A gateway on the other hand c an accept a packet formatted \\nfor one protocol (e.g. AppleTalk) and convert it to a packet fo rmatted for another protocol \\n(e.g. TCP/IP) before forwarding it. \\nA gateway is generally software installed within a router.  The gateway understands \\nthe protocols used by each network linked to the router and is th erefore able to translate from \\none to another. In some cases, the only modification nec essary are the header and trailer of \\nthe packet. In other cases, the gateway must adjust the data  rate, size and format as well. The \\nfollowing figure shows a gateway connecting an SNA network (IBM ) to a NetWare network \\n(Novell). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nGateway \\n \\n \\n Network Models: \\n Protocol definition: \\nA protocol is a set of rules that govern all aspects of data communication. A protocol \\ndefines what is communicated, how it is communicated, and when it is communicated. \\nThe key elements of a protocol are \\n107  \\n 1. Syntax \\n2. semantics \\n3. Timing \\n \\n \\nSyntax: \\nSyntax refers to the structure or format of the data, i.e. the order in which they are \\npresented. \\nSemantics: \\n \\nSemantics refers to the meaning of each section of bits . \\n \\nTiming: \\n \\nTiming refers to when data should be sent and how fast they can be sent. \\n \\n Standards: \\nA standard provides a model for development that makes it pos sible for a product to \\nwork regardless of the individual manufacturer. Standards are essential in creating and \\nmaintaining an open and competitive market for equipment manufacturers and in \\nguaranteeing national and international inter-operabili ty of data and telecommunications \\ntechnology and processes. They provide guidelines to manufac turers, vendors, government \\nagencies and other service providers to ensure the kind of inter connectivity necessary in \\ntoday’s  market place and in international communications. \\n \\nData communication standards falls into two categories  as below: \\n1. de facto (by fact or by convention) \\n2. de jure (by law or by regulation) \\n \\nCategories of standards \\nDe jure standards are those that have been legislated by an officially r ecognized \\nbody. Standards that have not been approved by an organized bod y but have been adopted to \\nstandards through widespread use are de facto standards. \\n108  \\n De facto standards are often established originally by manufacturers seeking to \\ndefine the functionality of a new product or technology. \\n \\nDe facto standards can be further subdivided into two classes: \\n1. Proprietary \\n2. Nonproprietary. \\n \\n \\nProprietary standards are those originally invented by a commercial organization as \\na basis for the operation of its products. They are cal led proprietary because they are wholly \\nowned by the company that invented them. These standards are  also called closed standards \\nbecause they close off communications between systems pr oduced by different vendors. \\nNonproprietary standards are those originally developed by groups or committees \\nthat have passed them into the public domain. They are als o called open standards because \\nthey open communications between different systems. \\n \\n OSI Model: \\nIntroduction: \\nIn 1978, the International Standard Organization (ISO) developed an architecture \\nthat would allow the devices of different manufacturers to work together to communicate \\nwith different operating systems. In 1984, the ISO architecture became an international \\nstandard known as the Open System Interconnection (OSI)reference model . This \\narchitecture determines how the hardware, software, topolog ies and protocols exist and \\noperate on a network. The OSI model is based on seven layers as in figure. \\nEach layer adds functionality to the previous layer and com municates with layers \\ndirectly above and below it. Because each layer of the OSI model handles a different part of \\nthe communication process, it makes the troubleshooting pro cess a little easier because it \\nprovides specifications on how components should function.  \\n109  \\n  \\n \\n \\nOpen System Interconnection (OSI) reference model \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Layered architecture: \\nThe OSI model is built of seven ordered layers: \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Application layer \\n\\uf0b7 Presentation layer \\n\\uf0b7 Session layer \\n\\uf0b7 Transport layer \\n\\uf0b7 Network later \\n\\uf0b7 Data link layer \\n\\uf0b7 Physical layer \\nFigure below shows the layers involved when a message is sent from device A to device B. \\n \\nAs the message travels from A to B, it may pass through many intermediate nodes. \\nThese intermediate nodes usually involve only the first thre e layers of the OSI model as in \\nfigure. The OSI model allows complete transparency between inc ompatible systems. \\n110  \\n  \\n \\nMessage passing \\n \\n \\nFunction of the layers : \\nThe function of each layer in the OSI model is discusse d below. \\n \\n \\nApplication layer: \\nThe application layer enables the user, whether human or software to access the \\nnetwork. It provides user interfaces and support for services  such as electronic mail, remote \\nfile access and transfer, shared database management, and other types of distributed \\ninformation services. \\nSpecific responsibilities of the application layer include the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Network Virtual Terminal \\n\\uf0b7 File transfer, access and \\nmanagement \\nPresentation layer: \\uf0b7 Mail services \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Directory services \\uf020\\nThe presentation layer is concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information \\nexchanged between two systems. \\n111  \\n Specific responsibilities of the presentation layer include the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Translation \\n\\uf0b7 Encryption \\n\\uf0b7 Compression \\n \\nSession layer: \\nThe services provided by the first two layers are not suf ficient for some processes. \\nThe session layer is the network dialog controller. It e stablishes, maintains, and synchronizes \\nthe interaction between communicating systems. \\nSpecific responsibilities of the session layer include the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Dialog control \\n\\uf0b7 Synchronization \\n \\nTransport layer: \\nThe transport layer is responsible for source- to-destination delivery of the entire \\nmessage. The transport layer ensures that the whole mess age arrives intact and in order \\noverseeing both error control and flow control at the  source- to-destination level. \\nFor added security, the transport layer may create a con nection between the two end \\nports. A connection is a single logical path between the source and destinati on that is \\nassociated with all packets in a message. \\nSpecific responsibilities of the transport layer include the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Service-point addressing \\n\\uf0b7 Segmentation and reassembly \\n\\uf0b7 Connection control \\uf0b7 Flow control \\n\\uf0b7 Error control \\n \\n \\nNetwork layer: \\nThe network layer is responsible for the source- to-destination delivery of a packet \\npossibly across multiple networks (links). The network laye r ensures that each packet gets \\nfrom its point of origin to its final destination. \\nIf two systems are connected to the same link, there is us ually no need for a network \\nlayer. However, if the two systems are attached to differe nt networks, there is often a need for \\nthe network layer to accomplish source- to-destination delivery. \\nSpecific responsibilities of the network layer include the following: \\n112  \\n \\uf0b7 Logical addressing \\n\\uf0b7 Routing \\n \\nData link layer: \\nThe data link layer transforms the physical layer, a raw  transmission facility to a reliable \\nlink and is responsible for node- to-node delivery. It makes the physical layer appear error \\nfree to the upper layer (network layer). Specific responsib ilities of the data link layer includes \\nthe following: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Framing \\n\\uf0b7 Physical addressing \\n\\uf0b7 Flow control \\n\\uf0b7 Error control \\n\\uf0b7 Access control \\n \\nPhysical layer: \\nThe physical layer coordinates the functions required to tran smit a bit stream over a physical \\nmedium. It deals with the mechanical and electrical specificati ons of the interface and \\ntransmission medium. It also defines the procedures and fu nctions that physical devices and \\ninterfaces have to perform for transmission to occur. Th e physical layer is concerned with the \\nfollowing: \\n\\uf0b7 Physical characteristics of interfaces and media \\n\\uf0b7 Representation of bits \\n\\uf0b7 Data rate \\n\\uf0b7 Synchronization of bits \\n\\uf0b7 Line configuration \\n\\uf0b7 Physical topology \\n\\uf0b7 Transmission mode \\n113  \\n  Summary of layer functions: \\nThe functions of seven layers are summarized in figure below. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nREVIEW QUESTIONS \\n \\nPART – A \\n1.

The conventions developed by ARPA to specify how i ndividual computers could \\ncommunicate across that network became TCP/IP. The adapt ability of TCP/IP and expansion \\nof ARPANET became the backbone of today’s  Internet. \\n \\n TCP/IP: \\nThe Transmission Control Protocol/Internetworking Protocol is a set or protocols or a \\nprotocol suite that defines how all transmissions are exchan ged across the internet. \\n \\nTCP/IP and the Internet: \\nAn internet under TCP/IP operates like a single network co nnecting many computers \\nof any size and type. Internally the Internet is an int erconnection of independent physical \\nnetworks linked together by internetworking devices. Figure shoes the topology of a possible \\ninternet. In this example, the letters A, B, C and so  on represent hosts. A host in TCP/IP is a \\ncomputer. The solid circles in the figure numbered 1, 2, 3 a nd so on are routers or gateways. \\nThe larger ovals containing numerals represent separate physical networks. \\n \\n \\nTCP/IP and the Internet \\nTCP/IP considers all interconnected physical networks to be one huge network. It \\nconsiders all the hosts to be connected to this larger logi cal network rather than to other \\nindividual physical networks. \\n116  \\n TCP/IP and OSI : \\nTCP/IP’s implementation of the OSI model makes functiona lity simpler by mapping  \\nthe same seven layers of the OSI model to a four layer mo del. Unlike the OSI reference \\nmodel, the TCP/IP model focuses more on delivering the internet connectivity than on \\nfunctional layers. It does this by acknowledging the import ance of a structured hierarchical \\nsequence of functions, yet leaves the protocol designers with the flexi bility for \\nimplementation. The OSI reference model is much better at explaining the mechanics of \\nintercomputer communications, but because TCP/IP has beco me the internetworking model \\nof choice, this model is more commonly used. \\nThe table below compares the OSI and TCP/IP models. \\n \\n \\nOSI Reference model TCP/IP Networking model \\nApplication layer  \\nApplication Layer Presentation Layer \\nSession Layer \\nTransport Layer Transport Layer \\nNetwork Layer Internet Layer \\nData Link Layer \\nNetwork Interface Layer \\nPhysical Layer \\n \\nComparison of OSI reference model and TCP/IP Networking model \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Application Layer: Maps to Layer 5 (Session), Layer 6 (Presentation) and La yer 7 \\n(Application) of the OSI model. This is how applications and certain services access \\nthe network. \\n\\uf0b7 Transport Layer: Maps to Layer 4 (Transport) of the OSI model. It accepts da ta and \\nsegments it for transport across the network, making s ure that the data is delivered \\nerror-free and in the proper sequence. \\n\\uf0b7 Internet Layer:   Maps to Layer 3 (Network) of the OSI model. It manages the \\nrouting of packets that are to be forwarded on to different networks, relying on \\nroutable protocols for delivery. \\n\\uf0b7 Network Access Layer: Maps to Layer 1 (physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link) of the \\nOSI model. It is responsible for the delivery of datagrams by  creating a frame for the \\nnetwork type and then sending the data to the wire. \\n117  \\n TCP/IP is a suite of protocols and applications that enable  a computer to communicate \\nwith other computers in a network. It doesn’t matter what opera ting system the computers are  \\nusing as long as each system supports TCP/IP. The computers then communicate and share \\ninformation. \\n \\n Connection oriented and Connectionless Services: \\nA transport layer protocol can either be connectionless o r connection-oriented. \\n \\n \\nConnectionless service: \\nIn a connectionless service, the packets are sent from o ne computer to another with no \\nneed for connection establishment and connection relea se. The packets are not numbered. \\nThey may be delayed, lost or arrive out of sequence. The re is no acknowledgment either. \\nUDP  is a connectionless protocol. \\n \\nConnection oriented Service: \\nIn a connection-oriented service, a connection is firs t established between the sender \\nand the receiver. Then, data are transferred. At the end,  the connection is released. TCP is a \\nconnection-oriented protocol. \\n \\n \\n Sockets: \\nA socket is an internal end point for sending/receiving at a single node in a computer \\nnetwork. Two processes need a socket at each end to commu nicate with each other. \\n \\n \\nSocket structure \\n \\n \\nThe above figure shows a simplified socket structure. The  fields are discussed below: Remote socket address Local socket address Protocol Type Family \\n118  \\n \\uf0b7 Family : This field is used for defining the protocol group such as IPv4 or IPv6, Unix \\ndomain protocol etc. \\n\\uf0b7 Type : This field is used for defining the type of socket such as stream socket, packet \\nsocket or raw socket. \\n\\uf0b7 Protocol : This field is usually set to zero for TCP and UDP. \\n\\uf0b7 Local socket address : It is used for defining the local socket address. This address is  \\na combination of local IP address and the port address of the local application \\nprogram. \\n\\uf0b7 Remote socket address : It is used for defining the remote socket address which is a \\ncombination of remote IP address and the port address of th e remote application \\nprogram. \\n \\nSocket types: \\nThe socket interface defines three types of sockets: \\n1. Stream socket \\n2. Packet socket and \\n3. Raw socket \\n \\n \\nAll these sockets are used in TCP/IP environment. Let us dis cuss them one by one. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStream socket: \\nThis is designed for the connection oriented protocol such as TCP. The TCP uses a \\npair of stream sockets for connecting one application program to the other across the Internet. \\n119  \\n Datagram socket: \\nThis type of socket is designed for the connectionless protoc ol such as UDP. UDP \\nuses a pair of datagram sockets for sending a message from one application program to \\nanother across the internet. \\nRaw socket: \\nRaw sockets are designed for the protocols such as ICMP, be cause these protocols do \\nnot use either stream packets or datagram sockets. \\n \\n TCP/IP Transport layer’s  Protocols: \\nThe protocol layer above the Internet layer is the Trans port layer. It is responsible for \\nproviding end- to-end data integrity. It also provides a reliable communica tion service so that \\nan extended two-way conversation may take place. \\nIt consists of two protocols TCP and UDP. \\n \\nTCP provides connection oriented data transmission, can support multiple data \\nstreams and provides for flow and error control. It uses sequence numbers and \\nacknowledgments to guarantee delivery. UDP  does not provide either sequencing or \\nacknowledgements. It is a connectionless protocol that is u sed in telephony traffic and the \\nRemote Procedure Call (RPC). \\nThe major difference between TCP and UDP is reliability. TCP is highly reliable and \\nUDP  is a best effort simple delivery method. One of the main functions of TCP and UDP  is \\nas a port manager for the applications that are in the top layer. The destination port number is \\nplaced in the header and is used to pass traffic to the cor rect application. \\n \\n \\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP): \\nTCP is the part of the protocol suite that provides functi onality for packets and error \\nchecking. Applications that require reliable data delivery u se TCP because it verifies that data \\nare delivered accurately and in the proper sequence. It also ensures that data are resubmitted \\nwhen transmission results in an error and also enables hosts to maintain multiple, \\nsimultaneous connections. \\nSockets make up a TCP connection. A socket consists of a n IP address and a port \\nnumber. Connections are determined by the IP addresses and the socket numbers of the two \\ncomputers trying to communicate. To establish a connection,  a machine needs to know the IP \\naddress and the port number on which the application communic ates. When the application \\nfirst starts using TCP, the receiver’s computer sets up a  buff er large enough to accommodate \\ntraffic for the data from the application. An acknowledgement (ACK) is periodically sent to \\n120  \\n the sender. If TCP receives ACKs that indicate a missi ng segment, it resends the missing \\nsegment and any segments sent after that to ensure that  all the data was sent. The two TCP \\nend points hold state information that in essence forms a virtual circuit. The virtual circuit is \\nfull duplex, meaning that data can go in both directions simu ltaneously. This virtual circuit \\nconsumes resources in both TCP endpoints; therefore it  requires more CPU and network \\nbandwidth. \\n \\n \\nThe two most typical network applications that use TCP are File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and \\nTelnet. Telnet uses port 23 and FTP uses port 21. Clients ca n find the desired server simply \\nby connecting to port 23 or 21 of TCP on the specified computer . The TCP protocol header is \\nillustrated if figure below. \\n \\n \\n \\nTCP protocol header \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe TCP protocol header is a minimum of 20 octets and con tains the following fields \\n:. \\n\\uf0b7 Source port : This that contains the port number of the application requesting the \\nconnection. \\n\\uf0b7 Destination port : This contains the port number of the application called in the \\nconnection. \\n\\uf0b7 Sequence number : This is used to reconstruct the data back into its original form at \\nthe destination number. \\n121  \\n \\uf0b7 Acknowledgement number : This identifies each sequence number of the packet \\nbeing acknowledged. It contains the sequence number of the  next expected octet. \\n\\uf0b7 Header length (HLEN) : The field indicates the number of 4 byte words in the TCP \\nheader. \\n\\uf0b7 Reserved : This is a 6-bit field reserved for future use. \\n\\uf0b7 Control : This field defines 6 flags that are used to specify services and operations \\nduring the session. \\n \\no URG  :Significant urgent pointer field \\no ACK  :Significant acknowledgement field \\no PSH : Use the push function \\no RST : Reset connection \\no SYN : Synchronize sequence numbers \\no FIN : Data has finished sending \\n\\uf0b7 Window size : This defines the size of the sliding window. \\n\\uf0b7 Checksum : This contains the checksum and used in error detection. \\n\\uf0b7 Urgent pointer : This 16-bit field, which is valid only if the urgent flag is set.  It is \\nused when the segment contains urgent data. the number is  added to the sequence \\nnumber of the last urgent byte in the data section of the  segment. \\n\\uf0b7 Options and padding: These are used to convey additional information to the \\nreceiver or for alignment purposes. \\n \\n \\n \\n User Datagram Protocol (UDP): \\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the other main protocol that resides on top of IP. \\nUDP is a connectionless datagram service that does not guarant ee delivery and does not \\nmaintain an end- to-end connection. It merely pushes the datagram out and acc epts incoming \\ndatagram. UDP adds to what IP provides by multiplexing information  between application \\nbased on port number. In other words, UDP gives application programs direct access to a \\ndatagram via ports. This direct access allows applications  to exchange messages over the \\nnetwork with a minimum of protocol overhead. \\nIf the amount of data being transmitted is small, the ov erhead of creating connections \\nand ensuring reliable delivery may be greater than the work o f retransmitting the entire \\ndatagram. Other applications provide their own techniques for re liable data delivery and do \\nnot require that service from the Transport layer protocol . Imposing another layer of \\n122  \\n acknowledgement is redundant. Some applications have a query/r esponse mechanism. The \\nresponse can be used as an acknowledgement to the query the reby verifying the connection. \\nUDP can also be used for exchanges of data that do not requir e any of the functionality that \\nTCP provides. The UDP protocol header is given in figure below  \\n \\n.  \\nUDP protocol header \\n \\n \\nThe fields are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Source port number: This contains the port number of the application requesting the \\nconnection. \\n\\uf0b7 Destination port number: This contains the port number of the application called in \\nthe connection. \\n\\uf0b7 Message length: It defines the length of the user datagram, header plus data.  \\n\\uf0b7 Checksum: It is field used to detect errors over the entire user datagr am. \\nExample network applications that use UDP are Network F ile System (NFS) and Simple \\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP). \\n \\nApplications of UDP: \\nThe following are some uses of UDP. \\n1. UDP is suitable for a process that requires simple request- response communication \\nwith little concern for flow and error control. It is not usually used for a process that \\nneeds to send bulk data, such as FTP. \\n2. UDP is suitable for process with internal flow and error control mechanisms. For \\nexample, the Trivial File Transport Protocol (TFTP) include s flow and error control. \\nIt can easily use UDP. \\n123  \\n 3. UDP  is a suitable transport protocol for multicasting. Multicas ting capabilities are \\nembedded in the UDP software but not in the TCP software. \\n4. UDP  is used for some routing update protocols such as Routing Information Protocol \\n(RIP). \\n \\nComparison of TCP and UDP: \\n \\nS.No. TCP UDP  \\n1. Applications that send continuous streams \\nof data at a steady rate use TCP. Applications that do not want a \\ncontinuous flow but send data \\noccasionally in the form of bursts use \\nUDP  \\n2. TCP establishes a connection before any \\ndata is actually transferred and data can be \\nsent only when the connection is active. \\nThe TCP layer at both the ends maintain \\nstate information about the connection. UDP does not set up any connection \\nbefore transmitting the data. So, it does \\nnot maintain any state information. \\n3. TCP puts at least 20 bytes in the header, \\nthus more overhead in the network traffic UDP  adds 8 bytes in the header and \\nthus less overhead over the actual data. \\n4. TCP takes care of errors that occur during \\ndata transfer. UDP  does not offer this facility. \\n5. TCP controls flow of data. UDP  does not control flow of data. \\n \\n 802.X Protocols: \\n \\nIEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and \\nmetropolitan area networks. These standards are restricted to networks  carrying variable-size. \\nThe services and protocols specified in IEEE 802 map to the lo wer two layers (Data \\nLink and Physical) of the seven-layer OSI networking reference model. In fact, IEEE 802 \\nsplits the OSI Data Link Layer into two sub-layers name d logical link control (LLC) \\nand media access control (MAC). \\n \\n \\n Concepts and PDU format of CSMA/CD (802.3): \\nEthernet networks use carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) to improve \\nperformance and reduce traffic. When a node has data to tra nsmit, it first listens on the cable \\nusing a transceiver to check whether a signal is being transm itted by another node. This is \\ndone by monitoring the current flowing in the cable. Data is transmitted when there is no \\n124  \\n current present and the physical medium is idle. CSMA is  a fundamental advance in access \\nand performance because it check whether the medium is active before sending a packet. If \\nthe channel is sensed as isle, it transmits. If the cha nnel is sensed as busy, it holds off the \\ntransmission until it can sense that the medium is idl e. \\nAt a time, if two stations are waiting to transmit, they wi ll send, as soon as each sense \\nthe medium is idle, causing a collision. Obviously, if a collision happens, we want to detect \\nand resolve it. The method that can be used to solve col lision issues is exponential backoff. In \\nthis method, when a collision occurs, a timeout is randomly  chosen and the transmission \\nresumes/backoff after timeout. \\nDuring this process, the node must continuously monitor the c ollision detection logic \\nto detect whether a collision occurs. If it does, it stops sending bits within a few bit periods , \\nstarts the collision procedure by sending a jam signal, and then calculates a retransmission \\ntime. This causes the other nodes to discard the frame a nd ensure that all stations are aware of \\na collision so that they can increment a timeout range. \\nCollision in CSMA/CD \\n125  \\n Frame format: \\nIEEE 802.3 specifies one type of frame containing seven fi elds: Preample, SFD, DA, \\nSA, length/type of PDU, 802.2 frame and the CRC.  The format of the MAC frame in \\nCSMA/CD is shown in figure. \\n \\n \\n \\n802.3 MAC frame \\n\\uf0b7 Preamble: It contains 7 bytes of alternating 0s and 1s to provide an alert and timing \\npulse. \\n\\uf0b7 Start Frame Delimiter (SFD): The second field (1 byte : 10101011) of the frame \\nsignals the beginning of the frame.. \\n\\uf0b7 Destination Address (DA): This field contains the physical address of the packet’s  \\nnext destination. \\n\\uf0b7 Source Address (SA): This field contains the physical address of the sender or last \\ndevice forwarding the packet. \\n\\uf0b7 Length/type of PDU: This field is the length or type field. \\n\\uf0b7 Data and Padding: This field carries data encapsulated from the upper-laye r \\nprotocols \\n\\uf0b7 CRC:  The last field contains error detection information. \\n \\n \\n Token bus (802.4): \\nThe IEEE802.4 standard for media access control is known as Token bus. It is used in \\nfactory automation and process control as it combines the  physical configuration of Ethernet \\nand the collision free (predictable delay) feature of token  ring. Token bus is a physical bus \\nthat operates as a logical ring using tokens. \\nToken bus is a linear or tree shaped cable through which different stations are \\ninterconnected. Logically, the interconnected stations f orm a ring as shown in figure below. \\nThe physical topology is also shown in figure. Each stat ion knows its own identification \\nnumber and the identity of the stations preceding and foll owing it. The sequence number and \\nthe physical location of a station on the bus are not related to each other. \\n126  \\n  \\n \\nPhysical topology in token passing Logical sequence of token passing \\n \\n \\nA look at the sequence of stations in the logical sequenc e of token passing shows that \\nthe stations connected in a bus are arranged in a logica l sequence. \\nAfter initialization of the logical ring, the station be aring the highest number sends out \\nthe first frame. After doing so, it passes permission to i ts neighboring station so that it can \\nsend its frame. This permission is passed by sending a spe cial control frame called Token. \\nThe operation of token bus takes place as follows : \\ni) At any time, the station which holds the token only can t ransmit its data frames on \\nthe bus. Every frame contains source and destination addr esses. \\nii) All other stations are ready to receive these data fram es. \\n \\niii) As soon as the transmission time of a station is over,  it passes the token to the next \\nstation in the logical sequence. The transmission is then  taken over by the next \\nstation. \\niv) In one cycle of operation, each station gets an opportun ity to transmit once. The \\nsame station can get more number of chances to transmit i n one cycle if more than \\none addresses are assigned to it. \\n \\n \\nThe frame format as specified by IEEE802.4 is shown in figure. \\n \\n \\n127  \\n The frame consists of the following fields : \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Preamble: Preamble is used for bit synchronization. \\n\\uf0b7 Start delimiter (SD): It marks the beginning of a frame. \\n\\uf0b7 Frame control (FC): It indicates the type of frame as data frame or control frame. \\nToken is a control frame. \\n\\uf0b7 Destination Address (DA): It contains the destination address \\n\\uf0b7 Frame Check Sequence (FCS): This field contains a CRC  code \\n\\uf0b7 End Delimiter (ED): This marks the end of the frame. \\n \\nThe active stations control and manage the token. Each  one of them can initiate and \\nrespond to the control frames such as claim token frame, solicit successor frame, set \\nsuccessor frame and who follows frame. The function o f these frames is to initialize the bus \\nand for adding or removing a station. \\n \\n Token ring (802.5): \\nA token ring system is shown in figure below. It consists o f a number of \\nstations connected to the ring through a Ring Interface Uni t (RIU). The Ring Interface Unit is \\na repeater and therefore it regenerates the received dat a frames and sends them to the next \\nstation after some delay. \\n \\n \\nToken ring \\n \\n \\nHere the access to the medium is controlled by the speci al control frame called \\ntoken. The token is passed from one station to the other a long the ring. The sequence of token \\npassing is dependent on the physical location of the station s connected to the ring. A station \\nwhich is in possession of the token only can transmit frames. It may transmit one or more \\ndata frames but before the expiry of Token Holding Time ( THT) which may be 10ms. After \\nthe holding time, the token frame must be handed over to some other station. \\n128  \\n The data frame proceeds around the ring, being regenerated  by each station. Each \\nintermediate station examines the destination address, finds that the frame is addressed to \\nanother station and relays it to its neighbor. The inten ded receiver recognizes its own address, \\ncopies the message, checks for errors and changes 4 bits  in the last byte of the frame to \\nindicate address recognized and frame copied. The full packet  then continues around the ring \\nuntil it returns to the station that sent it. \\nThe sender receives the frame and recognizes itself in th e source address field. It then \\nexamines the address-recognized bits. If they are set, it knows the frame was received. The \\nsender then discards the used data frame and releases th e token back to the ring. \\nIEEE802.5 has standardized the formats for the token frame  and data frame as in \\nfigure below. \\n \\n \\nFormat of 802.5 frames \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe token frame and data frame contain the following fie lds : \\n\\uf0b7 Start delimiter (SD) : It marks the beginning of a token or data frame. \\n\\uf0b7 Access Control (AC) : This consists of the Priority bits (P), token bits (T), \\nmonitoring bits (M) and reservation bits. \\n\\uf0b7 Frame control (FC) : It indicates the type of frame as data frame or control frame. \\n129  \\n \\uf0b7 Destination Address (DA) : It contains the destination address. \\n\\uf0b7 Source Address (SA) : It contains the source address. \\n\\uf0b7 Data Field (DF) : There is no limitation on the size of this field. The token holding \\ntime will decide the maximum size of the data field. \\n\\uf0b7 End Delimiter (ED) : This marks the end of the frame. \\n\\uf0b7 Frame Status (FS) : It consists of two address recognized bits (A), two frame  copied \\nbits (C) and reserved bits (X). \\nThe fourth bit of the AC (access control) field is cal led token bit. A station which is \\nwaiting to transmit its frame, waits for the token bit. As soon as the token bit is found to be 0 \\n(indicates a token frame) it seizes the token by disconne cting the ring at RIU. The station \\nthen inserts a 1 in place of 0 and continues with the re st of the data frame. Hence this station \\nhas grabbed the token and hence can transmit its data fram es on the ring. \\nRegarding priority management , the first three bits in the AC field are priority bits . \\nThe last three bits (R bits) are called reservation bits . They are used to reserve the priority \\nlevel. \\nIn the ring, one of the stations acts as an active monitoring station . If the token does \\nnot appear on the allotted time, it is presumed to be lost and the monitor generates a new \\ntoken and introduces it to the ring. \\n Types of Ethernet: \\nSeveral schemes have been devised to improve the performance of Ethernet LANs. \\nTwo of them are \\n \\n \\n1. Fast Ethernet 2.  Gigabit Ethernet. \\n \\n \\nFast Ethernet: \\nWith new applications such as CAD, image processing and real  time audio and video \\nbeing implemented on LANs, there is a need for a LAN with a data rate higher than 10 Mbps. \\nFast Ethernet is a version of Ethernet with a 100 Mbps  data rate. There is no change in the \\nframe format and in the access method. The only two ch anges in the MAC layer are the data \\nrate and the collision domain. The data rate is increased by a factor of 10. \\n \\nIn the physical layer, IEEE has designed two categories of Fast Ethernet: \\n \\n \\n1. 100Base-X and \\n2. 100Base-T4. \\n130  \\n The first uses two cables between the station and the h ub. The second one uses four. \\n100Base-X itself is divided into two types: \\n \\n1. 100Base- TX and \\n2. 100Base- FX \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCategories of Fast Ethernet implementations \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n100Base- TX : \\nThe 100Base-TX uses two category 5 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)  or two shielded \\ntwisted-pair (STP) cables to connect a station to the hub. One pair is used to carry frames \\nfrom the station to the hub and the other to carry frames from hub to the station. The \\nencoding is 4B/5B to handle the 100 Mbps, the signaling is NRZ-I.  The distance between the \\nstation and the hub should be less than 100 meters. \\n \\n100Base- FX : \\nThis design uses two optical fibers, one to carry frames from the station to the hub \\nand the other from the hub to the station. The encodin g is 4B/5B and signaling is NRZ-I. The \\ndistance between the station and the hub (or switch) sho uld be less than 2000 meters. \\n \\n \\n \\n100Base- T4 : \\nThis scheme was designed in an effort to avoid rewiring. I t requires four pairs of \\ncategory 3 (voice grade) UTP that are already available f or telephone service in most 100Base- T4 100Base- FX 100Base- TX 100Base-X Fast Ethernet \\n131  \\n buildings. Two of the four pairs are bidirectional and the oth er two are unidirectional. This \\nmeans that in each direction, three pairs are used at the same time to carry data. Because a \\n100 Mbps data rate cannot be handled by a voice grade UTP, t he specification splits the 100 \\nMbps flow of data into three 33.66Mbps flows. To reduce the b aud rate of transmission, a \\nmethod called 8B/6T is used in which each block of 8 bits is transformed into 6 bauds of \\nthree voltage levels (positive, negative and zero). \\n \\nGigabit Ethernet : \\nThe migration from 10Mbps to 100 Mbps encourages the IEEE802.3 com mittee to \\ndesign Gigabit Ethernet, which has a data rate of 1000 Mbps or  1 Gbps. The strategy is the \\nsame. The MAC layer and the access method remain the sa me, but the collision domain is \\nreduced. In the physical layer, the transmission media an d the encoding system change. \\nGigabit Ethernet is mainly designed to use optical fiber, a lthough the protocol does not \\neliminate the use of twisted pair cables. Gigabit Ethernet us ually serves as a backbone to \\nconne ct Fast Ethernet networks. \\nFour implementations have been designed for Gigabit Ether net : \\n \\n \\n1. 100Base- LX \\n2. 100Base- SX \\n3. 100Base- CX and \\n4. 100Base- T. \\n \\n \\nThe encoding is 8B/10B, which means a group of 8 binary bits are en coded into a group of 10 \\nbinary bits. \\n \\n \\nUse of Gigabit Ethernet \\n132  \\n  Comparison between 802.3, 802.4 and 802.5: \\n \\n \\nStandard \\nspecification 802.3 802.4 802.5 \\nStructure Size of the frame \\nformat is 1572 bytes Size of the frame \\nformat is 8202 bytes Variable size. \\nSize of the data field 0-1500 bytes 0-8182 bytes No limit \\nPriority No priorities Supports priorities Priorities are \\npossible. \\nFrame requirement Minimum frame \\nrequired is 64 bytes It can handle short \\nminimum frames It supports short \\nframes \\nEfficiency and \\nthroughput Efficiency decreases \\nwhen speed increases \\nand collision affects \\nthe throughput. Throughput and \\nefficiency at high \\nload are excellent Throughput and \\nefficiency at high \\nload are excellent \\nModem Modems are not \\nrequired Modems are required Modems are required \\nProtocol Protocol is simple Protocol is extremely \\ncomplex Protocol is \\nmoderately complex. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Network Layers Protocol: IP \\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) is the host- to-host network layer delivery protocol for the \\nInternet. IP is an unreliable and connectionless datagram pr otocol – a best effort delivery \\nservice. It means that IP provides no error control or flow control. IP uses only an error \\ndetection mechanism and discards the packet if it is cor rupted. IP does its best to deliver a \\npacket to its destination, but with no guarantees. \\n Datagram: \\n \\nPackets in the IP layer are called datagrams. Figure belo w shows the IP datagram \\nformat. A datagram consists of two parts : header and dat a. The header can be 20 bytes to 60 \\nbytes and contains information essential to routing and deli very. A brief description of each \\nfield is in order. \\n\\uf0b7 Version (VER) : It defines the version number of the IP. \\n\\uf0b7 Header length (HLEN) : It defines the length of the header in multiples of 4 bytes. \\n\\uf0b7 Service type : It defines how the datagram should be handled. \\n\\uf0b7 Total length : It defines the total length of the IP datagram. \\n133  \\n  \\nIP datagram \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Identification : This field is used in fragmentation. \\n\\uf0b7 Flags : The bits in the flags field deal with fragmentation \\n\\uf0b7 Fragmentation offset : The fragmentation offset is a pointer that shows the offset of \\nthe data in the original datagram \\n\\uf0b7 Time to live : It defines the number of hops a datagram can travel before it is \\ndiscarded. \\n\\uf0b7 Protocol : This field defines which upper layer protocol data are encapsul ated in the \\ndatagram (TCP, UDP, ICMP etc) \\n\\uf0b7 Header checksum : This field used to check the integrity of the header alone.  \\n\\uf0b7 Source address : It identifies the original source of the datagram. \\n\\uf0b7 Destination address : It identifies the final destination of the datagram. \\n\\uf0b7 Option : The Option field can carry fields that control routing,  timing, management \\nand alignment. \\n \\n Interior Gateway Protocols: (IGMP, ICMP, ARP, RARP  Concept only). \\nIn the Internet model or the TCP/IP suite, there are five network layer protocols : \\nARP, RARP, IP, ICMP and IGMP. \\nThe main protocol in this layer is IP, which is responsible for host- to-host delivery of \\ndatagram from a source to a destination. However, IP needs t he services of other protocols. \\n134  \\n IP needs a protocol called ARP to find the MAC (physical) addre ss of the next hop. \\nThis address must be passed to the data link layer, with the I P datagram, to be inserted into \\nthe encapsulating frame. \\nDuring datagram delivery, IP needs the services of ICMP to han dle unusual situations \\nsuch as the occurrence of an error. \\nIP is designed for unicast delivery, one source to destinatio n. Multimedia and other \\nnew applications in the Internet need multicasting deliver y, one source to many destinations. \\nFor multicasting, IP uses the services of another protocol called IGMP. \\n \\n \\n \\nIntroduction: \\nThe Internet is made of a combination of physical networ ks connected by devices \\nsuch as routers. A packet starting from a source host ma y pass through several different \\nphysical networks before finally reaching the destination ho st. \\n \\nIP address: \\nThe hosts and routers are recognized at the network leve l by their IP addresses. An IP \\naddress is an internetwork address. \\n \\nMAC address: \\nAt the physical network, the hosts and routers are recogni zed by their MAC \\naddresses. A MAC address is a local address. Its jurisdict ion is a local network \\nThe delivery of a packet to a host or a router requires t wo levels of addressing : IP \\naddress and MAC address. Two protocols are used to find the othe r address if one type of \\naddress is known. \\nThey are \\n1. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and \\n2. Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) \\n \\n \\nThe ARP maps an IP address to a MAC address, whereas the RARP maps a MAC address to \\nan IP address. \\n \\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP): \\nThe Address Resolution Protocol associates an IP address with the MAC address. On \\na typical physical network, such as a LAN, each device on a link is identified by a physical or \\nstation address usually imprinted on the network interface car d (NIC). \\n135  \\n Anytime a host or a router needs to find the physical address of  another host on the \\nnetwork, it sends an ARP query packet. The packet includes the physical and IP address of \\nthe sender and the IP address of the receiver. Because the sender does not know the physical \\naddress of the receiver, the query is broadcast over the  network. See figure below. \\nEvery host or router on the network receives and proces ses the ARP packet, but only \\nthe intended recipient recognizes its internet address an d sends back an ARP response packet. \\nThe response packet contains the recipient’s IP and physica l addresses. The packet is unicast  \\ndirectly to the inquirer using the physical address received in the query packet. \\nIn the figure below, the system on the left (A) has a packet that need to be delivered to \\nanother system (B) with IP address 141.23.56.23. System A need s to pass the packet to its \\ndata link layer for the actual delivery, but it does not kno w the physical address of the \\nrecipient. It uses the services of ARP to send an ARP reque st packet to ask for the physical \\naddress of a system with an IP address of 141.23.56.23. \\n \\n \\n \\nThis packet is received by every system on the physical ne twork, but only system B \\nwill answer it as in figure. System B sends an ARP reply packet that includes its physical \\n136  \\n address. Now system A can send all the packets to this destinati on using the physical address \\nit received. \\n \\nReverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP): \\nThe Reverse Address Resolution Protocol allows a host to discover its internet \\naddress when it knows only its physical address. A host is suppo sed to have its internet \\naddress stored on its hard disk. So, this will be in the ca se of diskless computer or computer is \\nbeing connected ti the network for the first time or a new computer with old NIC. \\nRARP works much like ARP. The host wising to retrieve its internet address \\nbroadcasts an RARP query packet that contains its physical address to every host on its \\nphysical network. A server on the network recognizes the RARP packet and returns the host’s  \\ninternet address. \\n \\n \\n \\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): \\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) provides unreliable and connec tionless datagram delivery. \\nHowever, it has two deficiencies : lack of error control and lack of assistance mechanisms. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) has been designed to compensate \\nfor the above two deficiencies. It is a companion to the I P. ICMP itself is a network layer \\nprotocol. However, the messages are not passed directly to the data link layer. Instead, the \\nmessages are first encapsulated inside IP datagrams befor e going to the lower layer as in \\nfigure above. \\nThe value of the protocol field in the IP datagram is 1 to indicate that the IP data are \\nan ICMP message. \\n137  \\n Applications: \\nThe ping command uses ICMP as a probe to test whether a station i s reachable. Ping \\npackages an ICMP echo request message in a datagram and sends it to the selected \\ndestination. The user chooses the destination by specifying its IP address on the command \\nline in a form such as \\nping 100.50.25.1 \\n \\nWhen the destination receives the echo request messages,  it responds by sending an \\nICMP echo reply message. If a reply is not returned within a set time, ping regards the echo \\nrequest several more times. If no reply arrives, ping indicates that the destination is \\nunreachable. \\nAnother utility that uses ICMP is tracert (trace route), which provides a list of all the \\nrouters along the path to a specified destination. \\nFive types of errors are handled by ICMP. The five error reporting messages are given \\nbelow. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nInternet Group Message Protocol (IGMP): \\nThe IP protocol can be involved in two types of communicati on : unicasting and \\nmulticasting. Unicasting is the communication between one  sender and one receiver. It is a \\none-to-one communication. However, sometimes, processes need to send the same message \\nto a large number of users simultaneously. This is called mu lticasting, which is a one- to- \\nmany communication. \\nIP addressing supports multicasting. All 32-bit addresses that start with 1110 (class D) \\nare multicast addresses. With 28 bits remaining for the gro up address, more than 250 million \\naddresses are available for assignment. \\nThe Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP) is a companion of the IP protocol. It is \\na protocol that manages group membership. In any network, there are one or more multicast \\n138  \\n routers that distribute multicast packets to hosts or other routers. IGMP gives multicast \\nrouters information about the membership status of hosts or routers connected to the network. \\nA multicast router may receive thousands of multicast pa ckets every day for different \\ngroups. If a router has no knowledge about the membership status  of the hosts, it must \\nbroadcast all these packets. This creates a lot of traff ic and consumes a lot of bandwidth. A \\nbetter solution is to keep a list of groups in the network for which there is at least one loyal \\nmember. IGMP helps a multicast router create and update a list of loyal members related to \\neach router interface. \\n IP Addressing: \\nIn addition to the physical addresses (contained on NICs)  that identify individual \\ndevices, an identifier used in the network layer of the I nternet model to identify each device \\nconnected to the Internet is called the Internet address  or IP address. An IP address in the \\ncurrent version of the protocol is a 32-bit binary address t hat uniquely and universally defines \\nthe connection of a host or a router to the Internet. \\nHowever, if a device has two connections to the Internet, via two networks, it has two \\nIP addresses. The IP addresses are universal in the sense th at the addressing system must be \\naccepted by any host that wants to be connected to the Inte rnet. \\nThere are two common notations to show an IP address : binary  notation and dotted \\ndecimal notation. \\nBinary notation: \\nIn binary notation, the IP address is displayed as 32 bits.  To make the address more \\nreadable, one or more spaces is usually inserted between eac h octet (8 bits). Each octet is \\nreferred to as a byte. So the IP address is referred to as a 32 -bit address, a octet address or a 4 \\nbyte address. The following is an example of an IP address in binary notation : \\n01110101 10010101   00011101   11101010 \\n \\n \\n Dotted Decimal Notation : \\n \\nTo make the IP address more compact and easier to read, Int ernet addresses are \\nusually written in decimal form with decimal point separating t he bytes. The following figure \\nshows an IP address in dotted decimal notation. Because each byte is o nly 8 bits, each \\nnumb er in the dotted-decimal notation is between 0 and 255. \\n139  \\n  \\nDotted decimal notation \\n \\n \\nClassfulAddressing : \\nIP addresses, when started, used the concept of classes. T his architecture is called \\nclassful addressing. In the mid 1990s, a new architecture calle d classless addressing was \\nintroduced which will eventually supersede the original architectur e. However most of the \\nInternet is still using classful addressing and the migrat ion is slow. \\nIn classful addressing, the IP address space is divided into five classes : \\n \\n1. Class A \\n2. Class B \\n3. Class C \\n4. Class D \\n5. Class E \\n \\nEach class occupies some part of the whole address space. We can find the class of an \\naddress when the address is given in binary notation or dotted decimal notation. \\nFinding the class in binary notation : \\nIf the address is given in binary notation, the first few bits can immediately te ll us the \\nclass of the address as in figure below. \\n \\n \\nFinding the class in binary notation \\n140  \\n Finding the class in dotted-decimal notation : \\nIf the address is given in dotted decimal notation, then we n eed to look only at the \\nfirst byte (number) to determine the class of the address.  Each class has a specific range of \\nnumbers. This is given in the figure below. \\n \\n \\n \\nFinding the class in decimal notation \\n \\n \\nThis means that if the first byte (in decimal) is between 0 and 127 inclusive, the class \\nis A. If the first byte is between 128 and 191 inclusive, the class is B and so on. \\nNet-id and Host-id: \\n \\nIn classful addressing, an IP address in classes A, B and C  is divided into net-id and \\nhosted. These parts are of varying lengths, depending on the  class of the address. The figure \\nbelow shows the net-id and hosted in bytes. \\nIn class A, one byte defines the net- id and the three bytes define the hosted. In class \\nB, two bytes define the net-id and two bytes define the hos ted. In class C, three bytes define \\nthe net-id and one byte defines the host-id. \\n \\nNet-id and host- id \\nFourth byte Third byte Second byte First byte \\n240 to 255 Class E 224 to 239 Class D 192 to 223 Class C 128 to 191 Class B 0 to 127 Class A \\n141  \\n Looking at the first byte of an address in decimal form a llows us to determine at a glance to \\nwhich class a particular address belongs. See fig below. \\nFrom To \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Subnets: \\nAs the number of networks increased, the available number of network IDs in \\ndifferent IP address classes became insufficient. In addition, the n etworks needed to be \\ndivided into small networks for better performance. This is  because on a network with large \\nnumber of nodes, the network traffic increases and the n etwork performance decreases. As a \\nresult, the concept of subnetting was introduced. \\nBenefits of subnetting: \\n1. Reduced network traffic \\n2. Optimized network performance \\n3. Simplified network management \\n4. Facilities spanning large geographical distances \\n \\n \\nSubnetting: \\nSubnetting is the process of dividing a given network into smaller ne tworks. The \\nIP addresses are divided into two parts, the network number and the host number. For a Class \\nB network, you can connect 216-2 hosts on a network. In this case, if you want a small  \\nnumber of hosts in a network, you will have many IP addresse s left unused resulting in \\ninefficient usage of the IP address space. Subnetting allevia tes this problem by borrowing \\nadditional bits from the host address and using that as part of the network address. For \\nexample, for a Class B network, you could include 8 bits o ut of 16 bits of the host address to \\ncreate 28-2 or 254 subnets, each having 28-2 or 254 hosts. Class A \\n \\nClass B \\n \\nClass C \\nClass D \\nClass E 0.0.0.0 127.255.255.255 \\n128.0.0.0 191.255.255.255 \\n192.0.0.0 233.255.255.255 \\n224.0.0.0 239.255.255.255 \\n240.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 \\n142  \\n Figure below shows Class B IP address before subnetting and after using 8 bits of the \\nhost address for subnetting. \\n \\nClass B IP address without Subnetting \\n \\nClass B IP address with 8-bit Subnetting \\n \\n \\n \\n8-Bit subnet for a Class B IP address \\nAny number of bits from the host fields can be used for subnett ing. Class A IP \\naddresses use byte1 and byte2 for the network address and byt e3 and byte4 for subnetting. \\n \\n \\nSubnet masks : \\nA subnet mask is a 32-bit number similar to an IP address. It  determines how an IP \\naddress is split into the network and host portions. Subnetti ng is internal to a network. To the \\noutside world, only the network part of the IP address is a pplicable. The other hosts on the \\nInternet are not aware of the subnetting used inside a network. \\nSubnet masks are used to extract the subnet and host informati on from an IP address. \\nSubnet masks are used to perform logical AND operations wit h the IP address received in a \\npacket to determine the subnet to which these packets belong. Ho wever, if this Class B \\nnetwork has 8 bits for subnetting, the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0 and the logical \\nAND with the IP address will yield 128.3.4.0, in which 128.3 is the n etwork address and .4 is \\nthe subnet address. \\nThe table below shows a list of Class B subnets and a varia ble number of bits being \\nused for subnetting and the resulting number of networks and m aximum possible number of \\nhosts for this that network. \\n \\n \\nNumber  \\nof \\nSubnet \\nBits Format of Subnet Bits \\n(Byte3.Byte4) Subnet Mask Number of \\nSubnets Number \\nof Hosts \\n2 XX000000.00000000 255.255.192.0 2 16382 \\n3 XXX00000.00000000 255.255.224.0 6 8190 \\n4 XXXX0000.00000000 255.255.240.0 14 4094 Network Byte Network Byte Host Byte Host Byte \\nNetwork Byte Network Byte Subnet Byte Host Byte \\n143  \\n 5 XXXXX000.00000000 255.255.248.0 30 2046 \\n6 XXXXX00.00000000 255.255.252.0 62 1022 \\n7 XXXXXX0.00000000 255.255.254.0 126 510 \\n8 XXXXXXXX.00000000  255.255.255.0 254 254 \\n9 XXXXXXXX.X0000000  255.255.255.128 510 126 \\n10 XXXXXXXX.XX000000  255.255.255.192 1022 62 \\n11 XXXXXXXX.XXX00000  255.255.255.224 2046 30 \\n12 XXXXXXXX.XXXX0000  255.255.255.240 4094 14 \\n13 XXXXXXXX.XXXXX000  255.255.255.248 8190 6 \\n14 XXXXXXXX.XXXXXX00  255.255.255.252 16382 2 \\n \\nClass B Network Subnetting table \\n \\n \\n Supernetting: \\nThe size of a class C block with a maximum number of 256 a ddresses may not satisfy \\nthe needs of an organization. Even, a mid size organizati on may need more addresses. \\nOne solution is supernetting. In supernetting, an organization can combine several \\nclass C blocks to create a larger range of addresses. In oth er words, several networks are \\ncombined to create a supernetwork. By doing this, an organizati on can apply for a set of class \\nC blocks instead of just one. For example, an organizatio n that needs 1000 addresses can be \\ngranted four class C blocks. The organization can then use these addresses in one \\nsupernetwork as in figure below. \\nsupernetwork \\n144  \\n Supernetmask : \\nWhen an organization divides its block into subnets, the fir st address in the subblock \\nand the subnet mask completely define the subblock (the range of addresses). In this case, \\nhowever, the first address alone is not enough; we must hav e the subnet mask. \\nSimilarly, when an organization combines several blocks into a superblock, we need \\nto know the first address in the block and the supernet mask.  In supernetting, we need know \\nthe first address of the supernet and supernet mask to define the range of addresses. \\nA Supernet mask is the reverse of a subnet mask. A subnet mask for class C has \\nmore 1s than the default mask for this class. A supernet  mask for class C has less 1s than the \\ndefault mask for this class. \\nThe following figure shows the difference between a subnet  mask and a supernet \\nmask. A subnet mask that divides a block into eight subblocks  has three more 1s (23 = 8) than \\nthe default mask; a supernet mask that combines eight bloc ks into one superblock has three \\nless 1s than the default mask. \\n \\nComparison of subnet, default and supernet masks \\n \\n \\n \\nCIDR notation can also be used when we have supernets. An  address in a supernet \\ncan be easily defined using this notation. For example the  notation 141.14.192.3/24 shows a \\nclass C address, but the address 141.14.192.3/21 shows that the address  belongs to a supernet \\nwith the mask 255.255.248.0. \\n145  \\n  Application Layer Protocols: \\n File Transfer Protocol (FTP) : \\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard mechanism provi ded by Internet for \\ncopying a file from one host to another. Transferring files from one computer to another is \\none of the most common tasks expected from a networking or internetworking environment. \\nAlthough transferring files from one system to another se ems simple and straight \\nforward, some problems must be dealt with first. For exam ple, \\n \\n \\n1. Two systems may use different file name conventions. \\n2. Two systems may have different ways to represent text a nd data. \\n3. Two systems may have different directory structures. \\n \\n \\nAll these problems have been solved by FTP in a very simpl e and elegant approach. \\n \\nFTP differs from other client-server applications in that it establishes two connections \\nbetween the hosts. One connection is used for data trans fer, the other for control informations \\n(commands and responses). Separation of commands and data  transfer makes FTP more \\nefficient. The control connection uses simple rules of  communication. We need to transfer \\nonly a line of command or a line of response at a time. The data connection on the other \\nhand, needs more complex rules due to the variety of dat a types transferred. \\nFTP uses two well known TCP ports : \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Port 21 is used for the control connection and \\n\\uf0b7 Port 20 is used for the data connection. \\n \\nThe following figure shows the basic model of FTP. \\n \\nFTP \\n146  \\n The client has three components : \\n\\uf0b7 the user interface \\n\\uf0b7 the client control process and \\n\\uf0b7 the client data transfer process \\n \\nThe server has two components : \\n\\uf0b7 the server control process and \\n\\uf0b7 the server data transfer process. \\nThe control connection is made between the control proce sses. The data connection is \\nmade between the data transfer processes. \\nThe control connection remains connected during the entire  interactive FTP session. The \\ndata connection is opened and then closed for each file transferred. It opens each time \\ncommands that involve transferring files are used, and i t closes when the file is transferred. In \\nother words, when the user starts an FTP session, the co ntrol connection opens. When the \\ncontrol connection is open, the data connection can be  opened and closed multiple times if \\nseveral files are transferred. \\nDetail steps of FTP: \\n\\uf0b7 FTP client contacts FTP server at port 21 specifying TC P as transport protocol. \\n\\uf0b7 Client obtains authorization over control connection. \\n\\uf0b7 Client browses remote directory by sending commands over con trol connection. \\n\\uf0b7 When server receives a command for file transfer, t he server opens a TCP data \\nconnection to the client. \\n\\uf0b7 After transferring one file, server closes connection. \\n\\uf0b7 Server opens a second TCP data connection to transfer another file. \\n\\uf0b7 FTP server maintains state i.e. current directory, earl ier authentication \\n \\nThe figure below shows the FTP data connection. \\n \\nFTP data connection \\n147  \\n  Telnet: \\nThere may be situations, where an user wants to be able to r un different application \\nprograms at a remote site and create results that can be transferred to their local site. Instead \\nof writing different client-server application programs fo r each desired service, a better \\nsolution is to write a general purpose client-server program that lets a user to log on to a \\nremote computer, use the services available on to a remote  computer and transfer the results \\nback to the local computer. \\nTELNET is a general purpose client-server application prog ram provided by TCP/IP. \\nIt is an abbreviation for TErminaLNETwork . TELNET enables the establishment of a \\nconnection to a remote system in such a way that the local terminal appears to be a terminal \\nat the remote system. \\n \\n \\nLocal login: \\nWhen a user logs into a local time-sharing system, it i s called local login. As a user \\ntypes at a terminal or at a workstation running a terminal emulator, the keystroke s are \\naccepted by the terminal driver. The terminal driver passes the characters to the operating \\nsystem. The operating system in turn interprets the com bination of characters and invokes the \\ndesired application program or utility. See figure below. \\n \\nLocal login \\n \\n \\nRemote login: \\nWhen a user wants to access an application program or util ity located on a remote \\nmachine, the TELNET client and server programs come into use. The user sends the \\nkeystrokes to the terminal driver where the local operating system acc epts the characters and \\n148  \\n sent to the TELNET client, which transforms the characters to a universal character set called \\nNetwork Virtual Terminal characters and delivers them to the local TCP/IP stack. \\n \\n \\nRemote login \\n \\n \\nHowever the characters cannot be passed directly to the oper ating system because the \\nremote operating system is not designed to receive charac ters from a TELNET server. It is \\ndesigned to receive characters from a terminal driver. Th e solution is to add a piece of \\nsoftware called pseudo terminal driver, which pretends that th e characters are coming from a \\nterminal. The operating system then passes the characte rs to the appropriate application \\nprogram. \\n \\n \\n \\n Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): \\nOne of the most popular network services is electronic mail (e-mail). Electronic mail \\nis used for sending a single message that includes text, vo ice, video or graphics to one or \\nmore recipients. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the standard mechanism for \\nelectronic mail in the Internet. SMTP provides mail exch ange between users on the same or \\ndifferent computers and supports \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Sending a single message to one or more recipients \\n\\uf0b7 Sending messag es that include text, voice, video or graphics. \\n\\uf0b7 Sending messages to users on networks outside the internet . \\n149  \\n @ Sending Mail : \\nTo send mail, the user creates mail that looks very simila r to postal mail. It has an \\nenvelope and a message. \\n \\nEnvelope : \\nThe envelope usually contains the sender address, the rece iver address and other \\ninformation. \\n \\nMessage : \\nThe message usually contains the headers and the body. The headers of the message \\ndefine the sender, the receiver, the subject of the messa ge and other information. The body of \\nthe message contains the actual information to be read by the recipient. \\n \\nReceiving Mail : \\nThe email system periodically checks the mailboxes. If a  user has mail, it informs the \\nuser with a notice. If the user is ready to read the ma il, a list is displayed in which each line \\ncontains a summary of the information about a particul ar message in the mailbox. The \\nsummary usually includes the sender mail address, the subjec t and the time the mail was sent \\nor received. The user can select any of the messages and d isplay its contents on the screen. \\n \\nAddresses : \\nTo deliver mail, a mail handling system must use an addressing s ystem with unique \\naddresses. The addressing system used by SMTP consists of two parts : a local part and a \\ndomain name, separated by an @ sign. \\nSee figure below. \\n \\n \\nAddress of the  The domain name \\nmail box on the of the destination \\nlocal site \\nEmail address \\nExample : ramesh1998@gmail.com \\n \\n \\nLocal Part : \\nThe local part defines the name of a special file called user mailbox. local part domain name \\n150  \\n Domain Name : \\nThe second part of the address is the domain name. An organization usually selects \\none or more hosts to receive and send s-mail; they are so metimes called mail exchangers. \\nThe domain name assigned to each mail exchanger either co mes from the DNS database or is \\na logical name (for example, the name of the organiz ation). \\n \\nUser Agent : \\nThe first component of an electronic mail system is the User Agent (UA). A user \\nagent sometimes is called a mail reader. \\n \\nServices provided by a User Agent : \\nA user agent is a software package (program) that composes, reads, replies to, and \\nforwards the message. It also handles mailboxes. The fo llowing are the services of a typical \\nuser agent. \\n \\n1. Composing messages \\n2. Reading messages \\n3. Replying to messages \\n4. Forwarding messages \\n5. Handling mailboxes \\n \\n \\n \\n Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) : \\nThe actual mail transfer is accomplished through mail transfer agents (MTA). To \\nsend mail, a system must have a client MTA, and to receive mail, a system must have a \\nserver MTA. \\nMTA client and server \\n151  \\n Commands and Responses : \\nSMTP uses commands and responses to transfer messages between an MTA client \\nand an MTA server. Each command or reply is terminated by  a two-character end- of-line \\ntoken. \\n \\nCommands and Responses \\n \\n \\nMail transfer phases : \\nThe process of transferring a mail message occurs in three phases : connection \\nestablishment, message transfer and connection terminatio n. \\n \\nConnection establishment : \\nAfter a client has made a TCP connection to the well known port 25, the SMTP server \\nstarts the connection phase. \\nMessage Transfer : \\nAfter connection has been established between the SMTP clie nt and server, a single \\nmessage between a sender and one or more recipients can be exchanged. \\n \\nConnection Termination : \\nAfter the message is transferred successfully, the client terminates the co nnection. \\n \\n \\n \\n Post Office Protocol, version 3 (POP3): \\nThe POP3 is simple, but it is limited in functionality. Th e client - POP3 software is \\ninstalled on the recipient computer; the server - POP3 software is installed on the mail server. \\nMail access starts with the client when the user needs to download email from the \\nmailbox on the mail server. The client (user agent) open s a connection with the server on \\nTCP port 110. It then sends its user name and password to ac cess the mailbox. Ther user can \\nthen list and retrieve the mail messages, one by one. Th e figure below shows an example of \\ndownloading using POP3. \\n152  \\n  \\nPOP3 \\nPOP3 has two modes : the delete mode and the keep mode. In the  delete mode, the \\nmail is deleted from the mailbox after each retrieval.  In the keep mode, the mail remains in \\nthe mailbox after retrieval. \\n \\n \\n \\nLimitations of POP3 : \\n1. POP3 does not allow the user to organize mail on the server, the user cannot have \\ndifferent folders on the server. \\n2. POP3 does not allow the user to partially check the contents of the e-mail before \\ndownloading. \\n \\n Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) : \\nThe Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used m ainly to access data on \\nthe World Wide Web. The protocol transfers data in the fo rm of plain text, hypertext, audio, \\nvideo and so on. It is called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol because it is used in an \\nenvironment where there are rapid jumps from one document  to another. \\n Universal Resource Locator (URL) : \\nThe World Wide Web uses Universal Resource Locators (URL) to r epresent hyper \\nmedia links and links to network services within HTML documents . It is possible to represent \\nalmost any file or service on the Internet with a URL. A URL looks like : \\nhttp://www.miocrosoft.com \\n153  \\n Port Host The first part of the URL (before two slashes) specifies  the method of access. The \\nsecond is typically the address of the computer on which th e information or service is to be \\nlocated. Further parts may specify the name of files, the port to connect to, or text to search \\nfor in a database. A URL is always a single line with no embedded spaces. \\nThe URL defines four things : Method, Host computer, Port and Path. The figure \\nbelow shows the body of a URL. \\n \\n:// : / \\n \\n \\nURL (Uniform Resource Locator) \\n\\uf0b7 The method is the protocol used to retrieve the document, for example HT TP. \\n\\uf0b7 The host is the computer where the information is located, although  the name of \\nthe computer can be an alias. Web pages are usually stored i n computers and \\ncomputers are given alias names that usually begin with t he characters www . This \\nis not mandatory. \\n\\uf0b7 The URL optionally can contain the port number of the server. \\n\\uf0b7 Path is the pathname of the file where the information is loc ated. \\n \\nFollowing are some examples of URL : \\nftp://www.mcafee.com/pub/readme.txt \\nhttp://www.prenhall.com/index \\nfile://www.oxford.edu/directory/index \\n \\n \\n \\n Domain Name System (DNS) : \\n \\n \\nTo identify an entity, TCP/IP protocols use the IP address which uniquely identifies \\nthe connection of a host to the internet. However, peo ple prefer to use names instead of \\naddresses. The naming scheme used in the Internet is called the Domain Name System \\n(DNS). \\nThe domain name system does specify values for the most significant segment, which \\nis called the top-level of the DNS. Table below list the pos sible top-level domains. Path Method \\n154  \\n Most Significant segment of a domain name (Generic domai n labels) \\n \\nDomain name Assigned to \\nCom Commercial Organization \\nEdu Educational Institution \\nGov Government Institution \\nInt International Organizations \\nMil Military groups \\nNet Network support centers \\nOrg Organization other than those above \\nCountry code A country \\nSeven additional top-level domains were proposed in 1997 to further divide the \\nnamespace and eliminate the overcrowding which has occurred in  the commercial domain. \\nThe proposed names include the following : firm, store, web, arts, rec, info and nom . Arts \\nand rec were proposed to accommodate organizations such as art museum s and recreational \\nweb sites; while nom was proposed to permit individuals to register their names. For many \\nreasons, however, the new names have not received offici al approval. \\nWhen an organization wants to participate in domain name sy stem, the organization \\nmust apply for a name under one of the existing top-level domains. For example, a \\ncorporation named “Videsh Sanchar Nigam  Limited” might request the domain vsnl under  \\nthe top-level domain com. If it approves the request, th e Internet authority responsible for \\ndomain names will assign the domain : \\n \\nvsnl.com \\nOnce an organization has been assigned a domain, the suff ix is reserved for the \\norganization : no other organization will be assigned the sa me name suffix. To obtain a \\ndomain, an organization must register with the Internet authority.  A unique domain suffix is \\nassigned to each organization. \\nCountry domains : \\nThe country domain section follows the same format as t he generic domains but uses \\ntwo character country abbreviations (e.g. in for India). For example, universities in the \\nUnited Kingdom and in India register under the domains : \\nac.uk \\nac.in \\nwhere ac is an abbreviation for academic and uk and in are the official country codes for the \\nUnited Kingdom and India. \\n155  \\n  \\n \\n \\n1.
